Patients with COVID-19 have experienced mild to severe respiratory illness, including\nfever, cough and shortness of breath. The virus that causes COVID-19 is new. It is not the same\nas other types of coronaviruses that commonly circulate among people and cause mild illness,\nlike the common cold.\nWhat is Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body\nparts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or\ngastrointestinal organs. It is not yet known what causes MIS-C. However, many children with\nMIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C\ncan be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have\ngotten better with medical care.\nWhere did this coronavirus virus come from?\nThis particular virus was first identified in China this winter and has caused an outbreak of illness\naround the world. There is a lot that we are still learning about COVID-19, but it is thought to\nspread mainly from person-to-person, between people who are in close contact with one\nanother (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or\nsneezes. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that\nhas the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, but this is not\nthought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nWhy can\u2019t I just take medicine to cure COVID-19?\nBecause COVID-19 is a viral infection, like the common cold, rather than a bacterial infection, it\ncannot be cured with an antibiotic like penicillin. Right now, we do not have a way to cure\nCOVID-19 and there is no vaccine to prevent it.\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nPeople with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported \u2013 ranging from mild\nsymptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.

This means that, in most cases, we can\u2019t use symptoms or a\nsimple examination to tell COVID-19 apart from the flu, a cold, or other respiratory infections.\nEmergency warning signs include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest,\nnew confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face. Please get medical attention if you\nnotice any of these symptoms.\nAre my kids at risk for developing severe symptoms from COVID-19?\nIt is important to know that all evidence from around the world indicates that children usually\nDO NOT develop severe disease.\nHigh-risk groups include smokers, older adults (particularly those over 65 years of age), and\npeople with underlying health issues such as lung disease, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.\nWhat are the symptoms of MIS-C?\n\u2022 Fever\n\u2022 Abdominal pain\n\u2022 Vomiting\n\u2022 Diarrhea\n\u2022 Neck pain\n\u2022 Rash\n\u2022 Bloodshot eyes\n\u2022 Feeling extra tired\nBe aware that not all children will have all the same symptoms. For more information on MIS-C,\nvisit the CDC website.\nWhat should I do if my child is sick with cold or flu symptoms?\nIn general, mild cough and cold symptoms can be managed at home. For most children you can\nuse Tylenol to treat fever or achiness.* 1 It is also important to make sure that your child stays\nhydrated. Gatorade, water, juice and popsicles are great choices for children older than the age\nof 1. For children younger than 1 year old, try Pedialyte. Let your child get plenty of rest. It\u2019s OK\nif your child isn\u2019t very hungry as long as he or she is drinking lots of fluids. Most children with\nviral respiratory illnesses recover well without any additional treatment or intervention.\nCan\u2019t we just test to be sure my child isn\u2019t sick with COVID-19?\nNot necessarily. At this time, state departments are limiting testing to people who are most at\nrisk. As private labs grow their ability to test, there may be more opportunities for testing. At\nthis point, in almost all cases, children with mild or even moderate illness will not receive testing\nso the tests can be given to those most at risk.\n\nIbuprofen should not be used in children younger than 6 months of age. Also some children with chronic medical\nconditions should not take ibuprofen. Please check with your pediatrician and specialists\n\n1\n\nLast Updated 5/26/2020\nFor additional information, visit https://in.gov/coronavirus.\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\nWhat Parents Need to Know about COVID-19\nWhy is COVID-19 such a big deal? Flu is here every year, and my kids do just fine?\nThere are three unique things about COVID-19 that make it a bigger deal for our communities.\n1) Because it is a brand-new virus, more people are likely to become infected.\n2) COVID-19 is easy to spread from person-to-person. It can be spread by droplets, like\nwhen someone coughs or sneezes near you or on surfaces you touch. This is why it is SO\nimportant to wash your hands frequently, clean surfaces and try and avoid touching\nyour face. This is how the virus is shared with other people. This is also why you should\nbe cautious about attending large gatherings or visiting anyone over age 65 for the time\nbeing because they are particularly at risk.\n3) In most people, COVID-19 causes mild illness, which means that people are more likely\nto continue doing usual activities, like going to work, school and to the gym. While most\ninfected children become only mildly ill, but they can easily spread the infection to other\npeople who are more at risk. This wouldn\u2019t be as big a deal if everybody only got mild\nillness, but some people can get very sick. Unfortunately, there have been people,\nalmost all of them older adults, who have died from COVID-19.\nWhat should I say when explaining COVID-19 to my kids?\n\u2022 Remain calm and reassuring. Remember that children will react to both what you say\nand how you say it. They will pick up cues from the conversations you have with them\nand with others.\n\u2022 Make time to talk. Be sure children know they can come to you when they have\nquestions.\n\u2022 Avoid language that might blame others and lead to stigma.\n\u2022 Remember that viruses can make anyone sick, regardless of a person\u2019s race or ethnicity.\nAvoid making assumptions about who might have COVID-19. Pay attention to what\nchildren see or hear on television, radio or online.\n\u2022 Consider reducing the amount of screen time focused on COVID-19. Too much\ninformation on one topic can lead to anxiety. Provide information that is honest and\naccurate. Give children information that is truthful and appropriate for the age and\ndevelopmental level of the child.\n\u2022 Talk to children about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media\nmay be based on rumors and inaccurate information.\n\u2022 Teach children everyday actions to reduce the spread of germs.\n\u2022 Remind children to stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing or sick.\n\u2022 Remind them to cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow, then throw the tissue into\nthe trash.\n\u2022 Get children into a handwashing habit.\n\u2022 Teach them to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially\nafter blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before\neating or preparing food.\n\u2022 If soap and water are not available, teach them to use hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer\nshould contain at least 60% alcohol. Supervise young children when they use hand\nsanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol, especially in schools and childcare facilities.\n\nLast Updated 5/26/2020\nFor additional information, visit https://in.gov/coronavirus.\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\nWhat Parents Need to Know about COVID-19\nWhen should I go to the emergency room?\nGo to the emergency room if your child is having an emergency. Here are some examples:\n1) Your child has stopped drinking and urinating. If your child is drinking and urinating a\nlittle bit less than usual that is OK. However, if it is a LOT less than usual, then call your\ndoctor or come to the emergency room.\n2) Your child is having difficulty breathing in their lungs. Children with colds frequently\nmay have trouble breathing through their noses. This is okay, as long as they are not\nhaving difficulty breathing in their lungs. Come to the emergency room if your child is:\n\u2022 Breathing a lot faster than normal\n\u2022 Using extra muscles to breathe, If this happens you may see them pulling in on\ntheir ribcage each time they take a breath or using extra muscles in their necks\n\u2022 Flaring their nostrils with each breath\n\u2022 Making grunting noises with each breath\n\u2022 Having trouble speaking\n\u2022 Having trouble drinking\n3) Your child is acting \u201cweird.\u201d Children who are sick with a cough, cold and flu are\ntypically less active than normal. For example, they may be crankier, want to sleep more\n\nor be held. This is normal. Bring your child to the emergency room if they seem newly\nconfused or unresponsive.\n\n4) What about fever? Children frequently get a fever with viral illnesses. This is the body\u2019s\nnormal response to help fight infection. Fever itself is not dangerous, but children with\nfevers generally feel worse and are not as excited about doing things such as drinking,\nwhich is very important. We treat their fevers to help them feel better. In some\nillnesses, the fever will not come all the way down to normal even with fever medicine,\nand that is OK. Also, as the medicine wears off, the fever may return. If the fevers\npersist for more than several days and don\u2019t respond to medicines, you should talk to\nyour doctor, sometimes you will need to be seen in the emergency department.\n5) Your child has a fever AND is immunosuppressed (either because of medication they\ntake or because of underlying illness). This includes children being treated for cancer,\nautoimmune diseases and sickle cell disease. You should call your doctor immediately\nanytime an immunosuppressed child has a fever.\nDon\u2019t go to the emergency department if you don\u2019t need to.\nYou will expose your children to illnesses they may not currently have and will expose others as\nwell. In addition, we want to keep our emergency rooms available to care for children with the\nkinds of emergencies we see every day. If you do decide to go to the emergency room, please\ncall ahead if possible so precautions can be taken to limit the spread to others.\nIf I go to the emergency department, and they send my child home, does that mean my child\ndoesn\u2019t have COVID-19?\nNo. COVID-19 looks just like lots of other illnesses we see, and we can\u2019t tell just by symptoms.\nWe also can\u2019t test most patients. In most cases we also can\u2019t write a note saying your child does\n\nLast Updated 5/26/2020\nFor additional information, visit https://in.gov/coronavirus.\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\nWhat Parents Need to Know about COVID-19\nNOT have COVID-19. (Or that you haven\u2019t been exposed.) If your child is sick, you need to be\nespecially careful about handwashing and staying home and away from others.\nSo, what should we do?\n1) Don't panic. COVID-19 is a big deal, and we need to take it seriously, but keep in mind\nthat kids seem to be recovering very well from this virus.\n2) WASH YOUR HANDS (and your children\u2019s) often. Hand sanitizer is good if you are on the\ngo.\n3) STAY HOME if your child or you are sick, even just a little bit sick. People who are a little\nbit sick share it with a lot of people, making a lot of people a little bit sick and a few\npeople very sick.\n4) Wear a FACE COVER when around others. Because of the danger of suffocation, do\nNOT put cloth face coverings on babies or children younger than 2 years.\n5) Protect those in your community at greatest risk \u2013 older adults and those with chronic\nillnesses \u2013 by doing steps 1 through 3.\nWhy are schools closed?\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nAll K-12 public schools will remain closed until June 30. Non-public schools are also\nordered closed. This date may be revised to extend through the end of the 2019-2020\nschool year if circumstances warrant.\nAll-state mandated assessments will be canceled for the current academic year. The\ngovernor has contacted U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to share the state\u2019s\nplan and also has asked the Superintendent of Public Instruction Dr. Jennifer McCormick\nto pursue any federal waivers needed to cancel the requirements for accountability,\nchronic absenteeism and state-mandated assessments. See the Indiana Department of\nEducation\u2019s FAQs for more information.\nConsult your school district\u2019s website for more schedule and other information about\nyour child\u2019s school and e-learning guidance.\n\nYou can find more information about talking to your kids here and here (Spanish).\n\nLast Updated 5/26/2020\nFor additional information, visit https://in.gov/coronavirus.\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n"], "images": [{"url": "https://static2.k12.com/content/dam/schools/ha/files/Hoosier_atIndy_logo_responsive.png", "path": "k12.com/Hoosier_atIndy_logo_responsive.png", "checksum": "53c6696ca3a2346e042ca2fc7d7f875c", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/ha/files/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "path": "k12.com/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "checksum": "03a598646c445dfd6a8b43316128fc5f", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/marketing/promos/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "path": "k12.com/School_Page_Sidebar_Graphic_FN.png", "checksum": "1e8069d4b7c1fb66f7498a65f0ba1ce6", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/ha/files/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "path": "k12.com/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "checksum": "03a598646c445dfd6a8b43316128fc5f", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static1.k12.com/content/dam/schools/ha/files/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "path": "k12.com/hoosier_we_are_graphics.png", "checksum": "03a598646c445dfd6a8b43316128fc5f", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "https://static2.k12.com/content/dam/schools/ha/files/Hoosier_atIndy_logo_responsive.png", "path": "k12.com/Hoosier_atIndy_logo_responsive.png", "checksum": "53c6696ca3a2346e042ca2fc7d7f875c", "status": "uptodate"}], "files": [{"url": "http://ha.k12.com//content/dam/schools/ha/files/Final-%20Continuous%20Learning%20Plan_HAINDY.pdf", "path": "k12.com/Final-%20Continuous%20Learning%20Plan_HAINDY.pdf", "checksum": "60631619c7052beb11e763295b28d982", "status": "uptodate"}, {"url": "http://ha.k12.com//content/dam/schools/ha/files/IN_COVID-19_ParentsFAQ%205.24.20.pdf", "path": "k12.com/IN_COVID-19_ParentsFAQ%205.24.20.pdf", "checksum": "530308113ee42d2e375d93a4ec067639", "status": "uptodate"}]},

For students, faculty, and staff to be successful, a safe and nurturing environment must exist in our buildings, the local community, our nation, and throughout the world.\nIn recent weeks our students, faculty, and staff have been impacted by the recent killings of black Americans and the resulting wave of outrage sweeping across the country. Our faculty and staff have extended themselves to virtually support students and families with processing feelings of anger, outrage, and fear heightened by the social and systemic injustices that continue in our country. JCFA stands with our students and families, and commits to creating an open and honest space for our students to have an active voice in the world around them. We must work to engage family members and community leaders in meaningful conversations that remove the barriers built by racism and discrimination to ensure our students and their families have access to a safe and nurturing environment in which to succeed.\nAs educators and community leaders its our duty to educate students on the struggles and injustices of systemic racism and to inspire and enable them to build a future that is honorable, inclusive and allows no place for racism and discrimination.\nJCFA is committing to the following to help build a better community for our students:\nIncrease sensitivity, diversity, and anti-racism training for students, faculty, staff, and Board members\nUpdating policies and processes to ensure our commitment to equality is clearly stated and supported for faculty, staff, and students\nImplementing best practices and developing curriculum to support students in becoming more self-aware of their own biases and the impact of racism and discrimination on the community\nCreating an opportunity for students to interact with the community, in particular members of the justice system, to help address concerns of racism, and develop clear lines of communication between youth and the community\nJoin JCFA in making a commitment to address these community divides head-on and to create a space for our students to be acknowledged, to be seen, to be understood, and to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Click Here to Request Enrollment Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJCFA Charter Schools provide a non-traditional pathway for Louisiana students to earn a high school diploma.

Minnesota\nTransitions Charter School (MTCS) students will use the Google Classroom or\nMoodle platforms for accessing content. Engagement with content will be\nconsidered attendance. In the event that a student is not able to access online\nresources, students will be provided with physical materials in support of distance\nlearning. Daily communication via phone, or other as needed/possible, between the\nstudent and/or families and an MTCS staff member will count for daily attendance\nand tracked by the designated program.

Faculty are expected to maintain the same hours of work per\nweek that they were assigned to when working in the building and have the same\nwork calendar as described in their contract. Employees working from home should\nbe accessible at all times during their scheduled work time, should attend and\nparticipate in all scheduled meetings and respond to calls, emails and other\nmessages in a timely manner. If an employee is unable to meet these availability\nexpectations, they are expected to communicate with their direct supervisor.\n\n2\n\nDistance Learning\nMTCS is committed to providing students with 1 to 1 devices so that each student\nhas access to daily interactions with their teachers. MTS Secondary and Banaadir\nAcademy will be open daily from 9:00-11:00 a.m. to allow for parents to pick up\ntechnology devices, other relevant learning resources, or meals. MTCS students\nare familiar with the Google Classroom and Moodle platform. These platforms will\nbe used for delivery of some content.

This includes access to free\nschool meals, access to school issued tech devices, access to free internet,\nconnecting families to community resources and communicating and translating\nessential school messages. Ongoing, family liaisons will be essential to ensuring\ncontinued student and family engagement in the distance learning process.\nOur school nurse is available by phone at any time to all of our families, students\nand staff are welcome to call the School Nurse at 612-202-8802.

Please be sure to arrive wearing a mask. Please do not enter the building without a mask.\u00a0 Call 810-364-1362 if you need a mask. Click here to view the MDHHS FAQ on face coverings.\n\n\n\nSelf-Monitoring & Temperature Checks - All staff and students will be required to self-monitor for any coronavirus symptoms, including a daily temperature check before arriving to the school building. An assurance document will be completed and signed by all staff and students. This must be signed by all students 18 years of age or older or their parent for students under the age of 18 BEFORE they will be allowed back in the school building. If you are experiencing any symptoms or have a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, please stay home. \n\n\n\nTransportation \u2013 VLA students can still choose from a variety of transportation methods including driving (with a permit on file), getting a ride, or using the Blue Water Area Transit Busing. Bus tickets will continue to be provided for all students riding the city bus. All students riding the bus will be expected to follow the safety protocols the city bus has in place, including wearing a mask and social distancing. Bus drop-off is roughly between 8:05-8:50am or 8:50-9:35am. Bus pick-up is roughly between 12:35-1:20pm. Please inquire with the main office to determine the best transportation option for your student.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFood - Students should have breakfast before arriving at VLA.\u00a0Beginning in October, a small food bag will be available to all students to grab-and-go when leaving. *Subject to change\n\nVisitors - Visitors/Parents are asked not to enter the building if at all possible.\u00a0 If you need to drop something off for a student, pick up a student, or communicate with a student, the main office would be happy to assist you by calling 810-364-1362. \u00a0If you must enter the building for any reason, you will need to wear a mask and complete a COVID Self-Screening Survey.\u00a0 This is posted on the building\u2019s front doors. Capture the QR code image using your phone\u2019s camera. It will direct you to the survey link.  \n\n\n\nPreparedness and Response Plan - For a detailed explanation of our safety plan, please visit our website or click here.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIllness and Recovery - We have and will continue to work closely with the St. Clair County Health Department on developing our illness and return protocols.\u00a0 All families/students are asked to self-screen for COVID-19 symptoms before coming to school each day.\u00a0\n\nIf a student has any of following symptoms, they should stay home: Fatigue, weakness, cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, muscle aches, runny nose, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, congestion and/or sore throat. \n\n\n\nIn addition to masks, social distancing, decreased classroom sizes, and increased cleaning protocols, we will be working to intervene quickly if or when students are ill or displaying COVID-19 symptoms. We will be working closely with the St. Clair County Health Department and following their directions should any additional response (including additional deep cleaning, quarantining individuals, temporarily closing a classroom etc.) are required.\u00a0 Please contact the main office should you have any questions about these procedures. Thank you for your cooperation in limiting the transmission of the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT information regarding COUNT DAY \u2013 October 7, 2020\n\n\n\nTo obtain full-time equivalent state funding for students, they are now REQUIRED to complete at least one activity in their coursework on count day, which is October 7, 2020. A log-in will no longer be enough. To better understand what constitutes as an activity, please contact the front office or one of the classroom teachers.\n\nAs many schools have been forced to incorporate at least some level of online learning, NEW LEGISLATION now mandates at least one two-way, course-specific conversation between each student and at least one of the classroom teachers WEEKLY for the entire 2020-2021 school year. We highly encourage students to initiate these conversations by letting staff know how their courses are going; asking for help, checks, or unlocks; checking-in; etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Everitt, Principal", "V\n\nL!X.\n\u2022\n\nirtual Learning\nAcademy\n\n1520 Michigan Rd, Port Huron, Ml 48060\n810.364.1362 I lax 810.364.3347\nsccvla.org\n\not St. Cl1 r County\n\nDistrict/PSA Template for the\nExtended COVID-19 Learning Plan\nas Described in Public Act 149, Section 98a\nAugust 27, 2020\nSeptember 3, 2020 Clarifications\nOn August 20, 2020 Governor Whitmer signed House Bill 5913 into law as Public Act 149.\nSection 98a states that in order to receive state aid for 2020-2021, districts must provide for\ninstruction under an extended COVID-19 Learning Plan (\"Plan\") that has been approved by an\nintermediate district or authorizing body.

While our online curriculum and platform allowed us to transition rather smoothly, we\nhave had to work diligently to ensure that many gaps have been addressed and minimized for all\nstudents including health and safety, mental health, technology, and content delive1y/support.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a p01iion of roughly 30% of our students working\ncompletely from home, a portion of roughly 3 0% of our students working solely in the building,\nand a p01tion of roughly 40% of our students splitting their time between work from home and\nwork in the building. After sending a survey out to students and families about the VLA building\nreopening in September, we saw those percentages change drastically. 80% of our students and\nfamilies stated that they did not intend to be back in the building but rather anticipated their\nstudent working solely from home going f01ward. The other 20% stated that they would likely\nbe back in the building to receive in person supp01t from our building teacher facilitators.\nTo effectively se1ve both populations of these students, VLA staff have worked through regular\ncollaboration and professional development to ensure a continuity of learning for all students\nwhether they are working in the building or working from home.\n\nVirtual Learning Academy of St. Clair County - Extended COVID-19 Learning Plan\n\n6\n\nEducational Goals\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nPlease outline and describe the educational goals expected to be achieved\nfor the 2020-2021 school year.

Under the\norder, school districts must adopt a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan laying\nout how they will cope with the disease across the various phases of the Michigan Safe\nStart Plan. In turn, the accompanying Michigan Return to School Roadmap offers a\nguide to the types of safety protocols appropriate during each phase. There\u2019s no\none-size-fits-all solution: What works in Lansing may not work in Sault Sainte Marie.\nDistricts will retain the flexibility to tailor their instruction to their particular needs and to\nthe disease conditions present in their regions.\u201d (EO-2020-142)\nEach district (public, public school academy (PSA), nonpublic, and intermediate school\ndistrict (ISD) that educates pre-K-12 students) shall submit a single completed\nAssurance Document and Preparedness Plan to its Board in time for approval by\nAugust 15 or seven days before the first day of school, whichever comes first. This\ntemplate, when completed, serves as a single Assurance Document and Preparedness\nPlan.\nThe Preparedness Plan will be collected by the Intermediate School District for public\nschool districts, the authorizing body for public school academies, or the\nchief/designated school administrator for nonpublic schools for transmission to the State\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction and State Treasurer by August 17, 2020.\nAdditionally, this Preparedness Plan must be posted on the district\u2019s/PSA\u2019s, or nonpublic\nschool\u2019s public website home page no later than August 17, 2020.

The mission Don and Reed set out to achieve was simple and straightforward, and it remains the same to this day: open and operate small, high-quality, college-prep charter schools in low-income neighborhoods.\nAspire now has 38 community-based schools serving over 15,500 students in California. Our schools range from TK through 12th grade, and College For Certain is the focus for every age group. Teachers and parents partner closely to ensure students are prepared to succeed in college, career, and life.\nAspires Vision\nAspires vision: Every student is prepared to earn a college degree.\nAspires Mission\nAspires mission is to open and operate small, high-quality charter schools in low-income neighborhoods, in order to:\nIncrease the academic performance of underserved students\nDevelop effective educators\nShare successful practices with other forward-thinking educators, and\nCatalyze change in public schools.\nEquity Focus\nAspire is committed to providing equitable opportunities for our students, families, and teammates. We use an equity lens to examine our policies, practices, and systems at Aspire to strive for all groups to increase access and benefit from our work. This belief is woven throughout our core values. Read more about Equity at Aspire.\nCore Values\nBienestar (Well-Being):\nCulture of Belonging: We seek to be known and seen at Aspire, where we can be our authentic selves and be comfortable sharing all aspects of our identities. We respect and celebrate each others differences, and approach one another with empathy and understandingno matter ones background or cultural history. Each person is valued and has a place in this community.\nCommunity Partnership: We are all connected and collectively responsible for the well-being of every member of our extended community. When one of us is let down, we are all let down. When one of us succeeds, we all succeed. Only in partnership and by listening deeply to one another, can we create collective movement.\n: Each person has unique dreams. At Aspire, we set a foundation for our scholars to gain knowledge, skills, and power to access and make choices for their families and post-secondary lives.\nJoy:\nAspires core values are a part of its culture, but they do not define the culture. Culture is a shared system of values, beliefs and behaviors that collectively determine how things are done in an organization; it includes but is not limited to values.\n\n\n\n Quick Content / Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Variable Content\n\n\n .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Aspire Public Schools is committed to equal opportunity for all individuals in education.

It was this experience that fueled his passion for educating at-risk students, and focused his efforts on behalf of young people who without the proper support and encouragement would be given up on, or would give up on themselves.\nThroughout his career, he has filled many roles in both public and charter schools; and now, as Principal of Chambers High School, his leadership instills in all his students the that through hard work and effort, they can accomplish any task and meet any goal.\nRaised in the Tampa Bay area, Dan is a graduate of the University of Florida, where he studied Communication Sciences and Disorders.\nClose\nIs your future on your mind?\nHey, Wait a minute . . .\nAre you telling me I can catch up on my credits and graduate with my class?\nOkay, I amlistening . . .\nTell me what I need\nto do to get started.\nAre you sure you\ncan help me? . . .\nYes, we are sure. Our students all have their own story for how they were either behind a grade and were not going to graduate.\nNews & Events\nChambers High School has\namazing student activities and programs.\nUsed for the like, share, comment, and reaction iconsProblem displaying Facebook posts.

I constantly procrastinated and gave up hope in the end, but I pushed through and got it done. Let that be a lesson to others to not do the same; don't slack off, don't procrastinate, get it done. Chambers High gives you so many opportunities to graduate and get your diploma. Take advantage of it. The classes are online so you can learn at your own steady pace, and if you still need help you can easily ask a teacher. I'm extremely thankful to Chambers High for giving me the opportunity to graduate, even when I thought I couldn't.\"David LopezWHAT STUDENTS SAY\n___WHAT STUDENTS SAY\n___\"The experience that I had at chambers high school is that the teachers are very helpful and would love for the students to do good and graduate. The thing I like about the school is that I can get along with teachers and students. I want to thank all the teachers for helping me with everything that I needed help with. Hopefully I complete all my assignments over the summer, that I can be done with high school and be successful and move on and come back for a visit to show the school my appreciation. The school is a good environment.\"Tony Evans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chambers High School Address: 698 Homestead Blvd\nHomestead, FL 33030\nPhone: (305) 909-6307\nPrincipal: Mr. Dan Walke\nEmail: dwalke@chambershigh.com\nEnrollment Manager: Kenyatta Franklin\nEmail: kfranklin@chambershigh.com\n\n\n Follow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Student NamePhone NumberEmail addressParent/Guardian NameAddressNumber, Street, City, State, Zip CodeHow did you here about us?Radio or Streaming AudioTelevisionYouTube or Streaming VideoSignBrochureCurrent SchoolWebsitePrincipalCurrent StudentFacebookInstagramCommunity EventPlease ask any questions here.This field should be left blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NorthStar 2020 All Rights Reserved.

Flexible school schedules shift from a series\nof fixed-time (e.g., 40\u201350 minutes) instructional periods\na day and toward substantially longer instructional\nperiods (e.g., 75\u2013150 minutes) characterized by more\ndiverse teaching and learning activities (Bevevino,\nSnodgrass, Adams, & Dengel, 1999). Brown (2001,\np. 2) noted that \u201ca number of authors have used the\nterms block scheduling, flexible scheduling, alternative\nscheduling, and intensive scheduling interchangeably;\u201d\nconversely, others use these and similar terms to\ndescribe clearly related but distinctly different\nalternatives to traditional fixed-period time\narrangements of the school schedule. For the purposes\nof this research summary, the term \u201cflexible\nscheduling\u201d is used to encompass the full array of\nalternative scheduling options that may be adopted by\nmiddle grades schools.\nFlexible scheduling patterns address the concern for\nmore appropriate learning environments for students\nand respond to the need, not for schools to be more\norganized, but to be more flexible and creative in their\nuse of time (Spear, 1992). It has become apparent to\npractitioners that the structure of the school schedule\ninfluences the degree to which middle grades schools\nrespond to the developmental needs of their students\n(Williamson, 1998). Flexible scheduling allows schools\nto optimize time, space, staff, and facilities and to add\nvariety to their curriculum offerings and teaching\nstrategies (Canady & Rettig, 1995). Additionally, by\nallowing for larger time blocks, flexible scheduling\nreduces the amount of time that students spend out of\nclass (e.g., time spent moving between classes), which\nallows for more instructional time and less time during\nwhich students are more indirectly supervised.\nFlexibility of the schedule also serves to ease the\ntransition of students from the self-contained\nelementary environment to the highly departmentalized\n\nhigh school environment. Teachers are able to use time\nwisely to improve their teaching strategies and enhance\ncurricular integration (DeRouen, 1998; Seed, 1998).\nTeachers are directly involved with students and are the\nbest judges of time requirements for learning activities.\nBlocks of time enable them to make choices and have\nmore control over the learning environment.\nWith large blocks of time to facilitate involvement,\nstudents benefit from less fragmentation and more\nengagement in project-based learning and\ninterdisciplinary activities, promoting skill application,\ninterpersonal relations, and decision-making skills\nrelated to concrete, relevant problems (Vars, 1993).\nSimilarly, Arhar (1992) found that flexible scheduling\nincreased student engagement and achievement and\npositive social ramifications (Arhar, 1992).\nTypes of Flexible Scheduling\nWhile the flexibility of the school schedule is limited\nonly by the creativity of the teachers and administrators\nin the school, various models have emerged as popular\nover time. Four such models are summarized here.\n1. Block Scheduling. Most often used by\ninterdisciplinary teams, blocks of time usually consist\nof two or more combined periods (Hackmann, 2002).\nIn its simplest form, blocks are all the same length of\ntime (e.g., 100 minutes). For example, in the\ncommon \u201c4 X 4\u201d (four-by-four) scheduling\narrangement, students take only four classes in the\nfirst half of the year and four different classes in the\nsecond half of the year. In more creative\narrangements, length of time devoted to each time\nblock may vary based on the instructional needs of\nthe teachers and students (e.g., core academic\nsubjects may be assigned to longer blocks while\nadvisory and electives are assigned to shorter\nblocks), and length of time devoted to any given\nblock may vary from day to day. A common block\narrangement in middle level schools consists of two\nblocks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon\nor, alternately, one before lunch and one after lunch.\nNational Middle School Association\n4151 Executive Parkway, Suite 300\nWesterville, Ohio 43081\nPhone: (800) 528-NMSA\nFax: (614) 895-4750\nwww.nmsa.org\n100_03486\n\n2. Alternate Day Classes. Sometimes referred to as\nan \u201cA/B schedule,\u201d this arrangement assigns classes\non an every-other-day basis during the week. A\nstudent can take music on Mondays, Wednesdays,\nand Fridays (A schedule), and art on Tuesdays and\nThursdays (B schedule), with the core academic\nclasses meeting all five days. Or, a career class and a\nstudy skills class can meet on alternate days, taught\nby two teachers or the same teacher, depending on\nstaffing requirements. In some middle grades\nschools, the use of the A/B alternate day schedule\nrefers to students taking two core academic classes\n(i.e., mathematics, science) on one day and the other\ntwo core academic classes (i.e., language arts, social\nstudies) on the alternate day.\n3. Rotating Schedules. Following a master schedule of\nall classes in sequence, classes are held at different\ntimes each day, by rotating the classes one period\nlater each day. This process enables students to have\nall subjects at various times of the day and can be\nimplemented by teams or by an entire school.\n4. Dropped Schedule. Students are scheduled for\nmore classes than class periods, with one class\nbeing dropped on any given day. This schedule\nprovides allotted times for advisory programs,\nelectives, assemblies, and other curricular offerings\nbeyond core academic requirements.\nWhile all of these alternatives pose the opportunity for\ngreater flexibility, it is important that teachers and\nadministrators not become so enamored with any\nparticular alternative that it becomes just as restrictive\nas the traditional six- to eight-period day (Brown, 2001;\nHackmann & Valentine, 1998).\nSummary of the Research\nWhile middle grades advocates for several decades\nhave recommended flexible scheduling (cf. Alexander,\nWilliams, Compton, Hines, Prescott, & Kealy, 1969;\nBeane, 1993; Curtis & Bidwell, 1977; Epstein &\nMacIver, 1990; Hackmann, 2002; Kindred,\nWolotkiewicz, Mickelson, & Coplein, 1981; National\nMiddle School Association, 1995, 2003), middle grades\nschools have been somewhat slow to jettison the\ntraditional fixed-period day. The last two decades have\nshown a trend toward greater flexibility, however. In a\nnational study, Valentine, Clark, Irvin, Keefe, and Melton\n(1993) reported that more than 90% of middle schools\nused traditional fixed time schedules, with seven\ninstructional periods of 41 to 55 minutes per each\nperiod. These findings were corroborated by Epstein\nand MacIver (1990) and Alexander and McEwin (1989).\nJust a few years later, however, McEwin, Dickinson,\nand Jenkins (1996) found that 40% of sixth and\n\nseventh grades and 27% of eighth grades surveyed had\nimplemented some form of flexible scheduling, leading\nthe researchers to conclude, \u201cthese data demonstrate\nthe continued growth of team organizations with flexible\ncontrol over daily schedules\u201d (p. 38). In a similar 2003\nstudy, McEwin, Dickinson, and Jenkins found one-third\nof fifth through eighth grades used some option other\nthan self-contained or uniform periods. Meeks and\nStepka (2004), in a statewide study, found that middle\nlevel principals in Arkansas overwhelmingly regarded\nflexible scheduling as a staff development need for their\nfaculty, despite a number of years of implementation,\nnoting, \u201cTraining is not needed just to implement middle\nlevel programs, but it is also needed to sustain and\nrefine those changes\u201d (p. 10).\nMost exemplary middle schools use some form of\nflexible scheduling. In a survey of nominated exemplary\nmiddle grades schools (George & Shewey, 1994), 75%\nof the respondents indicated that flexible scheduling\nwas moderately to well developed at their schools. In a\nstudy by Brown (2001) using structured interviews with\n10 middle grades teachers involved in block scheduling,\nteachers reported a wider variety of instructional\nstrategies that were more consistent with their\nstudents\u2019 learning needs under block scheduling than\nthey had used previously under traditional scheduling.\nTeachers also noted that they tended to cover slightly\nless content in greater depth under block scheduling.\nBrown concluded:\nTeachers describe[d] implementing several changes\nin their instructional strategies that benefit students:\nproviding greater opportunities for student\nreflection; designing activities that promote critical\nand creative thinking through extended\nopportunities for manipulation of concepts and\nprinciples; and use of more student-to-student\ncollaborative learning experiences. (p. 9)\nIncreased flexibility in scheduling has also been linked\nto a decrease in disciplinary problems among middle\ngrades students (Smith, Pitkin, & Rettig, 1998). Reports\nfrom individual schools have confirmed increases in the\nlevels and amount of collaboration among teachers on\nteaching teams within a flexible scheduling\nenvironment (McLeod, 2005; Seed, 1998).\nInterestingly, most of the research on flexible\nscheduling has been conducted at the high school level.\nFollowing his review of the literature, Brown (2001,\np. 3) noted, \u201cFew studies on the implementation and\nimpact of alternative scheduling at the middle school\nlevel exist.\u201d For example, studies at the middle level\n\ninvestigating the effects of flexible scheduling on\nimportant student outcomes (e.g., achievement, critical\nthinking, motivation, self-esteem and other affective\noutcomes) are relatively limited. Lewis, Cobb, Winokur,\nLeech, Viney, and White (2003), however, did\ninvestigate instructional effects of middle level students\nin three scheduling arrangements (traditional, alternate\nday, and 4 X 4 block scheduling) across two studies.\nOne study focused on science standardized\nachievement test scores and the other on language arts\nachievement test scores. Comparisons favored\nachievement of students in the flexible scheduling\narrangements in both science and language arts, with\nlower achieving students, in particular, benefiting from\nflexible scheduling.\n\nRecommendations\nWhile flexible scheduling is gradually becoming more\ncommonplace in middle grades schools, a large\npercentage of schools are opting for self-contained\nenvironments or fixed-time instructional periods. Flexible\nscheduling options allow teachers greater flexibility in\nplanning, foster interdisciplinary teaching, and provide\nopportunities to effectively serve the needs of students.\nAs McEwin and associates (2003, p. 50) have noted, \u201cAll\nmiddle schools should adopt some form of flexible block\nscheduling that provides teachers with multiple\nopportunities to make sound decisions regarding\ncurriculum and instruction for young adolescents they\nteach.\u201d The further adoption of flexible scheduling\npractices should be accompanied by additional research\non the effects of varying scheduling arrangements on\nyoung adolescents\u2019 academic achievement, social and\nemotional development, and psychological well-being.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, W.

Specifically, the author explored participants\u2019 perceptions of the ability of the 4 X 4 block schedule, as implemented, to\nmeet the needs of their students and their perceptions regarding the effects of the block schedule on their instructional decision\nmaking. Interview transcripts were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Nine of 10 participants indicated they had altered\ninstruction (e.g., used more cooperative learning, problem solving, and computer-based activities). Similarly, 9 participants indicated the\nimplementation of the block schedule had positively affected their students learning (e.g., strengthened students\u2019 understanding of\nconcepts, increased students\u2019 success as they moved from grade to grade). All participants indicated they had modified the curriculum\nas a result of block scheduling (e.g., reduced breadth of content coverage, increased depth of coverage), and half noted that they had\naltered their assessment strategies (e.g., focused less on rote memorization and more on problem solving).\n\nLewis, C.

Two studies, one examining science performance (n = 340) and one examining language\narts performance (n = 111) were conducted. Achievement was measured on a standardized test. Small to moderate statistically\nsignificant effects were found for instructional format and for the instructional format by achievement level interaction, with differences\nfavoring students in the flexible scheduling arrangements. Examination of mean performance data indicated that lower achieving\nstudents, in particular, benefited from the flexible scheduling designs. While results should be replicated across other similar studies,\nthe favorable outcomes of flexible scheduling are promising and have interesting implications for educational policymaking, in light of\nthe high stakes testing environment that currently exists in the United States.\n\nANNOTATED REFERENCES\n\n(continued)\n\nMcEwin, C.

We\nplan to offer a powerful model for effective public education that meets the unique needs of its students and families\nensuring that every student has the opportunity to reach his or her true potential in accordance with the Michigan\nAcademic Standards.\n\nHighpoint Office: 231-307-4707 or (Toll Free) 855-337-8243\n\nMain Office (Reception) Ext: 7001\nHead of School, Mary Moorman Ext: 7002 (mmoorman@highpointva.org)\nOperations Manager, Cynthia Corey: Ext: 7003\nSpecial Programs Manager, Nancy Tuckey Ext: 7004 (ntuckey@highpointva.org)\nK5 Principal, Timothy Jalkanen Ext: 7800 (tjalkanen@highpointva.org)\nK5 Assistant Principal, Laura Wiechertjes Ext: 7828 (lwiechertjes@highpointva.org)\nMS Principal, Stacy Little Ext: 7839 (slittle@highpointva.org)\nHS Principal, Christina Brasil Ext: 7010 (cbrasil@highpointva.org)\nStudent Support Administrator, Julia Zoutendyk Ext: 7008 (jzoutendyk@highpointva.org)\n\n6\n\nHVAM Where to Go for Help\n\nOffice Phone: 855-337-8243\nOffice Fax: 231-375-2245\nAddress: PO Box 596 Mesick, MI 49668\nHead of School: Mary Moorman (mmoorman@highpointva.org)\nK5 Academics\nMS/HS Academics\nK12 Technical Support/\nHomeroom Teacher\nCourse Content Teachers\nCustomer Care\n\uf0fc Daily Lessons\n\uf0fc Course Content\n\uf0fc Assessments\n\uf0fc Assessments\nTechnical Support:\n\uf0fc ClassConnects\n\uf0fc ClassConnects\nwww.help.k12.com\n\uf0fc Your Child\u2019s Progress/ Grades\n\uf0fc Grades\nOR\n\uf0fc Course Placement\n\uf0fc Please contact your Special\n1-866-K12-CARE\n\uf0fc Student and Family Concerns\nEducation Teacher for concerns\n\uf0fc Please contact your Special\nrelated to the IEP and related\nPress 2 at the Prompt for Options:\nEducation Teacher for concerns\nservices.\nOption 1: Materials\nrelated to the IEP and related\nOptions 2: Technical Support\nservices.\nOption 3: Login Information and\nOnline Systems Support\nPrincipal\nPrincipal\nTim Jalkanen Ext: 7800\nChristina Brasil Ext: 7010\nFamily Academic Support Team\nFamily Support\nMS/HS Counselors\nFAST\nJulia Zoutendyk Ext: 7008\nJesse Harrison\n\uf0fc McKinney-Vento/Homeless\nKatelyn Ruedger\nAdvisors (Grades K-12)\n\uf0fc Advisor Team\n\uf0fc Course Assignments\n\uf0fc Progress/Grades\n\uf0fc Social/Emotional Concerns\n\uf0fc Attendance\n\uf0fc Family Engagement\n\uf0fc Program Navigation\n\uf0fc Facebook Page and Newsletters \uf0fc Credits/ Transcripts\n\uf0fc Graduation Planning\n\uf0fc Program Orientation\n\uf0fc Learning Coach\n\uf0fc Post-Secondary/Dual Enrollment\n\uf0fc Re-Registration and State\nCommittee/Learning Coach\n\uf0fc EDP\u2019s (Educational Development\nTesting\nTeacher Organization\nPlans) and Career Planning\n\uf0fc Student and Family Concerns\n\uf0fc Navigation/Getting Started\n\uf0fc Withdrawals\n\uf0fc Transcripts\n\uf0fc Outings\nAttendance/Truancy\nSpecial Program Support\nOperations Manager\nNancy Tuckey Ext: 7004\nExt: 7003\n\uf0fc\nSpecial\nEducation\n\uf0fc Computer Approvals\nReport Attendance to:\n\uf0fc\n504\nPlans\n\uf0fc Change in Address/Phone/\nhvamattendance@highpointva.org\n\uf0fc Child Find\nLearning Coach\n\uf0fc Title IX/Discrimination\n\uf0fc\nRecords\nCompliancy Liaison/Truancy\n\uf0fc Immunizations\nOfficer\nTim Jalkanen Ext: 7800\n\uf0fc Transfers and Withdraws\nMuaz Redzic: Ext: 7017\n\uf0fc Title 1 Programs\n\uf0fc Unresolved Technical Support\n\uf0fc English Language Learner Support\nIssues\nMary Moorman Ext: 7002\n\uf0fc Head of School\n\uf0fc Foster Care Liaison\n\uf0fc All concerns unresolved by\nTeachers/FAST or Principals\n\n7\n\nWhere To Go With Questions Or Concerns\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan staff recognizes that life at school does not always run smoothly. As\nproblems arise, school personnel and parents must collaborate to seek solutions. Highpoint Virtual Academy of\nMichigan staff also realizes that parents and students do not always know what to do or where to seek out\nanswers. Parents often give up and become frustrated if problems remain unsolved. Please follow these\nprocedures for general information or for assistance in resolving a problem:\nStep 1: All concerns and issues should first be directed to the student\u2019s teacher. If a Highpoint Virtual\nAcademy of Michigan teacher cannot resolve the issue (e.g., materials and computer issues) he or she directs\nthe parent/guardian to the appropriate contact for assistance. The Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\nteacher will monitor the concern to ensure resolution.\nStep 2: If the issue or concern is about the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan teacher, parents are advised\nto contact the grade level principal/administrator as applicable.\nStep 3: If the concern is not resolved at the teacher or lead teacher levels, parents/responsible adults are\nadvised to contact the Head of School.\n\nEmergency Closings and Communication Procedure:\n\nIn the event of an emergency or if a scheduled outing or activity such as state testing must be cancelled, Highpoint\nwill notify families via email, our family Facebook page, and an \u201cAutodialer\u201d call via Blackboard Connect.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Academic Calendar\nHighpoint will make educational services available to pupils for a minimum of at least 1,098 hours\nduring a school year, and will ensure that each pupil participates in the educational program for at least\n1,098 hours during a school year. The school calendar provides 180 instructional days for students.\nHVAM will afford students 24/7 access to the online school\u2019s curriculum and lessons throughout the school year.\nStudents will be expected to log into the online school every official school day for approximately 7 hours although this\nmay vary from day to day depending on lesson length and individual student needs.\nAttendance will be recorded based on log in\u2019s, communications with teachers, completion of course\nwork, and participation in class activities. In the event that a student has login and communications that\ndo not substantiate sufficient lesson completion, the school will work with the learning coach, teachers,\ncounselor, and academic administrator in place.\n\n8\n\nAcademic Calendar:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nSeptember 1, 2020\nFirst Day of School\nSeptember 4-7\nNo School: Labor Day Weekend\nOctober 7, 2020\nFall Count Day\nOctober 16, 2020\nNo School: Teacher In-Service\nNovember 3, 2020\nStudent Half Day\nNovember 6, 2020\nQuarter 1 Ends\nNovember 25\u201327, 2020\nNo School: Thanksgiving Holiday\nWednesday, December 23, 2020 \u2013 Friday, January 1, 2021\nNo School: Winter Break\nStudents return January 4, 2021\nJanuary 15, 2021\nQuarter 2 Ends/End of First Semester\nJanuary 18, 2021\nNo School: Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday\nJanuary 19, 2021\nStudent Half Day\nFebruary 10, 2021\nSpring Count Day\nFebruary 15, 2021\nNo School: President's Day\nMarch 26, 2021\nQuarter 3 Ends\nStudent Half Day\nMarch 29\u2013 April 2, 2021\nNo School: Spring Break\nMay 14, 2021\nNo School: Teacher In-Service\nMay 31, 2021\nNo School: Memorial Day\nJune 10, 2021\nLast Day of School\n9\n\n10\n\nNon-Discrimination Equal Educational Opportunity Policy\nTitle IX Coordinator:\n\nNancy Tuckey\n855-337-8243 X 7004\nntuckey@highpointva.org\n\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Civil Rights by calling 1-800-421-3481\n\nNon-Discrimination Policy:\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan (HVAM) is committed to providing an environment that is free from all forms of\nsex discrimination, which includes sex discrimination, sexual harassment (including sexual violence), as regulated by Title\nIX, and to insuring the accessibility of appropriate grievance procedures for addressing all complaints regarding all forms\nof sex discrimination and sexual harassment.

Sexual harassment can be verbal, nonverbal or physical.\nAny individual, who believes they may have experienced any form of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, or who\nbelieves that they have observed such actions taking place, may receive information and assistance regarding the\nSchool\u2019s policies and reporting procedures from any of the following:\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan (HVAM) is committed to providing an environment that is free from all forms of sex\ndiscrimination, which includes gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence, as regulated by Title IX,\nand to insuring the accessibility of appropriate grievance procedures for addressing all complaints regarding all forms of sex\ndiscrimination and sexual harassment.

Furthermore, HVAM reserves the right to pursue sexual misconduct violations that fall outside of\nthe scope of Title IX based on HVAM\u2019s judgment that the alleged actions are contrary to any part of its code of conduct.\nINFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE\nSex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment means conduct of a sexual nature that meets any of the following:\n\u2022\n\nSex discrimination occurs when a person, because of their sex, is denied participation in or the benefits of any\neducation program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.\n\nSexual harassment means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\n1) A school employee conditioning education benefits on participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (i.e., quid\npro quo); or\n2) Unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would determine is so severe, pervasive, and objectively\noffensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity; or\n3) Sexual assault (as defined in the Clery Act), dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in the\nViolence Against Women Act (VAWA). Sexual harassment can be verbal, nonverbal or physical.\nAny individual, who believes they may have experienced any form of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, or who\nbelieves that they have observed such actions taking place, may receive information and assistance regarding the School\u2019s\npolicies and reporting procedures from any of the following:\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Any student, parent/guardian, current or prospective employee or other individual within the\nschool community who believes they have experienced and/or observed and/or is aware of sex discrimination or sexual\nharassment (\u201cgrievant\u201d) should promptly report the matter to the school\u2019s Title IX Coordinator, a school counselor, principal\nor other school administrator.\nA \u201cformal complaint\u201d is a document filed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment\nagainst a respondent and requesting that the school investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A \u201cnonformal\ncomplaint\u201d is any notification regardless if by mail, telephone, or email, not utilizing the formal complaint form or not signed\nby a complainant or by the Title IX Coordinator.\nResponse to a Formal Complaint\nIn response to a formal complaint, the school will follow the defined grievance process within this procedure. With or\nwithout a formal complaint, the school, if it has actual knowledge of sexual harassment against a person in an education\nprogram or activity, will take certain steps such as offering supportive measures to the complainant to address student safety\nand provide equal access to the education program or activity while preserving the recipient\u2019s discretion to address facts or\ncircumstances present by a particular situation.\nComplaints of alleged sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, brought forth by students, parents/guardians, current\nor prospective employees, and other members of the school community will be promptly investigated in an impartial and in\nas confidential a manner as reasonably possible, so that corrective action can be taken if necessary.\nPrivacy Protections\n\n12\n\nThe school will never use or attempt to use questions or evidence that is protected by a legally recognized privilege, unless\nthe person holding the privilege waives the privilege.\nThe school cannot unilaterally access or consider a party\u2019s records, if those records are made or maintained by a physician,\npsychiatrist, or other recognized professional and made for the purpose of providing treatment to the party. These records\ncan only be accessed with a party\u2019s voluntary written consent.\nDuring the grievance process, questions or evidence about the Complainant\u2019s prior sexual behavior \u2013 even with the\nrespondent accused of sexual harassment, and even in the cases where the respondent already possesses evidence about\nsexual history \u2013 are never deemed relevant, with only two narrow and limited exceptions.\nThe grievance procedures will be as follows:\n1. It is the express policy HVAM to encourage the prompt reporting of claims of sex discrimination and/or sexual\nharassment. Once the school has \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of sexual harassment, or allegations of sexual\nharassment, the school will respond within 24 hours. \u201cActual knowledge\u201d means notice or allegations received\nby Title IX coordinator, school official with authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the school, or\nany school employee. The school must treat a person as a complainant any time the school has notice that the\nperson is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment (regardless of whether\nthe person themselves reported, or a third party reported the sexual harassment), and irrespective of whether\nthe complainant ever chooses to file a formal complaint. Further, it should be noted, there is no time limit or\nstatute of limitations on a complainant\u2019s decision to file a formal complaint.\n2. At the time the complaint is filed, the grievant shall promptly be given a copy of these grievance procedures\nand a description of the supportive measures offered by the school. A formal complaint form for such purpose\ncan be found on our website and will also be provided to the grievant upon notification of such complaint. It is\nthe responsibility of the Title IX Coordinator or designee to explain these procedures and measures and answer\nany questions anyone has. As it pertains to students, in appropriate circumstances, due to the age of the student\nmaking the complaint, a parent/guardian or school administrator may be permitted to fill out the form on the\nstudent\u2019s behalf. In addition, if the grievant is a minor student, the Title IX Coordinator should consider whether\na child abuse report should be completed in accordance with HVAM\u2019s policy on the Reports of Suspected Child\nAbuse or Neglect of Children.\n3. The Title IX Coordinator or designee shall investigate the complaint as promptly as practicable but in no case\nmore than ten (10) working days from the date the complaint was received. The Title IX Coordinator or designee\nshall have the complete cooperation of all persons during the investigation.\n4. The Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice to the parties identified in the complaint. The written\nnotice will include, the allegations and facts that may constitute sexual harassment, the presumption of that\nthe accused did not engage in prohibited conduct, notice that parties are entitled to an advisor of their\nchoice, parties can request to inspect and review certain evidence, a copy of the code of conduct, false\nstatements (if any), the opportunity to engage in informal resolution, the right to appeal, the range of\npossible remedies and disciplinary sanctions following determination of responsibility, and which standard of\nevidence will be used to reach a determination.\n13\n\n5. The Title IX Coordinator or designee shall meet with all individuals reasonably believed to have relevant\ninformation, including the grievant and the individual(s) against whom the complaint was lodged, and any\nwitnesses to the conduct. The investigation shall be carried on by the school discreetly, maintaining\nconfidentiality insofar as reasonably possible while conducting an effective investigation. The investigator will\nobjectively evaluate all relevant evidence regardless of who it favors or disfavors. Where facts are in conflict,\ncredibility determinations can be made. However, credibility determinations will not be based on a person\u2019s\nstatus as a complainant, respondent, or witness. Following the evaluation, the investigator will prepare an\ninvestigative report and will share the report with all parties before a determination regarding responsibility is\nreached.\n6. Prior to sharing the investigation report, the Title IX Coordinator must provide all parties a copy of the\nevidence used to form the basis of the report, and allow all parties 10 days to submit a written response. All\nwritten responses received will be objectively reviewed and considered by the school\u2019s investigator before\nissuing the report. Further, the Title IX Coordinator must afford each party the opportunity to submit written,\nrelevant questions that a party wants asked of any party or witness, provide each party with the answers, and\nallow for additional, limited follow-up questions from each party.\n7. Finally, the school\u2019s identified decision-maker, not the Title IX Coordinator or investigator, will make a\ndetermination and provide written determination of responsibility to both parties simultaneously. The\nwritten determination will include:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIdentification of the allegations potentially constituting sexual harassment as defined in \u00a7106.30;\n2027\nA description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the formal complaint\nthrough the determination, including any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and\nwitnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held;\nFindings of fact supporting the determination;\nConclusions regarding the application of the recipient\u2019s code of conduct to the facts;\nA statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a\ndetermination regarding responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions the recipient imposes on the\nrespondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient\u2019s\neducation program or activity will be provided by the recipient to the complainant; and\nThe recipient\u2019s procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and respondent\nto appeal.\n\n8. If after an investigation, the decision-maker determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that sex\ndiscrimination or sexual harassment in violation of the school\u2019s policy has occurred, HVAM shall take\nappropriate corrective action in an effort to ensure that the conduct ceases and will not recur. The Title IX\nCoordinator or designee shall also provide and or arrange for support services that are individualized, nondisciplinary, non-punitive, protect the safety of all parties and educational environment, deter harassment,\nand are not unreasonably burdensome. Such support services may include, no contact orders, academic\naccommodations, health and mental health services, disability services, confidential counseling or training\nwhere appropriate.\n14\n\nDetermination\nHVAM will consistently apply the same \u201cstandard of evidence\u201d in all formal complaints, in making a determination of\nresponsibility. Per Title IX regulations, there are two \u201cstandard of evidence\u201d options,\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nPreponderance of evidence \u2013 a majority of the evidence proves a fact. Mathematically, it would be more\nthan 50% of the evidence.\nClear and convincing evidence \u2013 a heightened standard which requires more than a preponderance of\nevidence to prove a fact. One definition of clear and convincing evidence is something that is highly and\nsubstantially more probable than not.\n\nHVAM will apply the following \u201cstandard of evidence\u201d -Clear and Convincing Evidence. The same standard of evidence\nfor formal complaints will be applied for formal complaints against all parties, including but not limited to students,\nemployees, and teachers.\nDisciplinary Sanctions and Remedies\nA range of different disciplinary sanctions or remedies may be implemented by the school following a determination\nof responsibility. Due to the unique nature of the situation and individual needs, the following is a non-exhaustive list\nof possible actions,\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nsupport services may be warranted and may include, no contact orders, academic accommodations,\nhealth and mental health services, disability services, confidential counseling or training where\nappropriate\nverbal or written warning\naltered schedules to eliminate interaction opportunities\nexclusions from certain school activities\naccess to recorded class sessions in lieu of live participation\nsuspension or expulsion\n\nAppeal Process\nUnder \u00a7 106.45(b)(1)(viii), all parties have the right to appeal for specified reasons.

An individual\nclassconnect meeting will be held to review the IRIP. Attendance by a parent or guardian at this meeting is required.\nThe new reading law requires a third grade student to be retained if an appropriate level of reading competency is\nnot met by the end of third grade according to the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress (MSTEP) by\nschool year 2019-2020. Certain exemptions specifically outlined in the Third Grade Reading Law may apply.\n\nAcademic Advancement (Grades K-5):\n\nIt is important to understand that the decision to advance a student to the next course or grade level is made jointly\nby the parent, teacher and principal. The decision focuses on what is in the best interest of the child. Academic\nachievement through content mastery is the cornerstone of Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan and the K12\ncurriculum. Highpoint understands children do not learn at the same rate or in the same manner. The program offers\nfamilies flexibility in scheduling and instructional strategies. Our program focuses on mastery of lesson objectives,\nencouraging families and students to spend the time needed daily and throughout the year to reach mastery of most\nlesson objectives.\n27\n\nAcademic achievement through content and standard mastery is the cornerstone of HVAM and the K12\ncurriculum. The K12 curriculum is rigorous, broad and offers optional extension activities in the lessons. Students who\nneed additional challenges are encouraged to complete all extension activities. Students who achieve a score in the\n90th percentile or above, during NWEA testing in the Fall will be placed in enrichment Class Connect sessions to help\nsupplement the grade level content. Supplemental material will be suggested by the teacher for students to\ncomplete at home with the Learning Coach. Advanced students are encouraged to complete 2-3% weekly progress\nsupplementing as necessary.\n\nK-5 Promotion and Retention:\nThroughout the school year, Michigan grade level standards will be measured for all students in grade K-5. At the end\nof each quarter, a snapshot will be created for each student that outlines actual course progress and expected\nprogress for that point in the school year. Learning goals will also be defined from student- teacher interaction along\nwith results from local assessments, work submissions, and K12 Online School. The learning goals will be monitored\nfor the entire school year. At the end of the 2nd and 4th quarter, a formal \u201creport card\u201d will be sent via mail.\nPercentage is calculated from the following: (Expected Online School Progress 75% of Grade, Teacher Created\nAssignments/School Assessments 25% of Grade)\nLess than 60% Expected Progress: NY (Not Yet Meeting Progress Goal)\n60 \u2013 79% Expected Progress: AP (Approaching Progress Goal)\n80 \u2013 100% Expected Progress: M (Meet Progress Goal)\nStarting in Grade 4 and 5 grades will be assigned to students to begin to prepare them for the rigor of Middle School.\n\nGrading Scale: (Expected Online School progress 75% of grade, Teacher-created assignments/School assessments\n25% of grade)\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\n\n4.0\n3.7\n3.3\n3.0\n2.7\n2.3\n\n93-100%\n90-92%\n87-89%\n83-86%\n80-82%\n77-79%\n\nC\nCD+\nD\nDF\n\n2.0\n1.7\n1.3\n1.0\n0.7\n0.0\n\n73-76%\n70-72%\n67-69%\n63-66%\n60-62%\n0-59%\n\nGrade Appeals:\n\nQuestions regarding all grades should be directed to the Homeroom Teacher initially to resolve questions. If\nunresolved, questions should be directed to the Principal for further investigation and final grade awarded. The\nPrincipal will adjust and reissue the report card or progress report if adjustments are made. Grade appeals must occur\nwithin six weeks of semester end.\nAfter the Third Quarter, teachers will notify learning coaches whose students are at risk for grade level retention. A\nmeeting will be arranged with the student, learning coach/parent, teacher, and administrator to make a team\ndecision regarding retention based on current student information.\nIt is imperative that all students attend each scheduled \u201crequired\u201d live ClassConnect session, individual teacher\nconferences, and participate in all assessments \u2013 either face-to-face and/or Blackboard Collaborate. As their progress\n28\n\nis monitored, students may be asked to attend supplemental tutoring sessions for additional instructional support.\nThese are integral tools for gathering information about individual strengths and weaknesses and monitoring ongoing\nprogress to ensure student success. These measures also help in determining mastery levels which will be reported on\nthe student\u2019s progress reports. Promotion or retention for the next grade level will be determined as the cumulative\nresults of the student\u2019s progress and achievement for the school year are analyzed at the end of the academic year.\nOur goal is not to make all children alike, but to foster individual strengths and help each child develop to his or her\nfullest potential. Please note, if your child is receiving special education services, the learning goals that have been\ncreated and recorded on the students IEP for him/her will supersede this list of grade level standards; however,\nassessment on grade level standards may still occur.\n\nOnline School (OLS) Progress:\n\nThe K12 curriculum is outstanding and helps students master state standards. Therefore, it is always recommended\nthat students master all core lessons in the Online School. The goal will be 100% progress unless otherwise\ndetermined by the teacher.\nTeachers will provide a list of assignments from the Online School that should be submitted directly to the teacher.\nThis work will allow the teacher to give detailed feedback. It is important that students master and retain their work\nand not just work through assignments. If at any time it becomes clear that a student has not mastered work that is\nmarked complete, the lessons may need to be completed again. In addition, students should have their own student\naccount and should not have access to teacher guides or answer keys.\nCommunication with the student\u2019s teachers is another key to our unique partnership. Students who ask for assistance\nfrom their teachers have shown greater success in this type of virtual model. To assure that students are meeting\nmastery, each student and parent must be available to attend conferences set up by the teacher, as well as weekly\nhomeroom meetings, and Classroom Connect sessions. Students need to attend and to interact with their teachers\nand other students during these sessions. Experience has taught us that students who become actively engaged with\ntheir teachers and other students achieve at a higher level.\n\nTeacher Assigned Projects and Assignments:\n\nTeachers will assign projects and assignments directly into the curriculum within the Online School. The addition of\nthese assignments may cause the curriculum lesson numbers to appear incorrect. This is a part of the system and is\nnot an error. These projects are meant to engage students and bring in key state standards not addressed through\nthe Online School curriculum. These projects and assignments are to be submitted directly to the teacher and will be\ngraded. The grades will be reflected in the student\u2019s report cards.\n\n29\n\nThe Middle and High School Program (Grades 6-12)\n6-12 Principal\n\nChristina Brasil\n855-337-8243 X 7010\ncbrasil@highpointva.org\nIn grades 6-12 the focus begins to shift towards more independent learning for students.\n\u2022 Students are expected to take on more accountability and responsibility for their learning.\n\u2022 Student and teacher interaction increase with teachers continuing to provide instruction directly.\n\u2022 Students are expected to develop more independent study skills and to submit more assignments to be\nevaluated or graded to their teachers.\nK12 Inc. utilizes their Learning Management System (LMS) to provide the online school campus and courses. The\nschool campus site features school announcements, messages from the administration, access to important\ndocuments, club and organization information, guidance counseling resources, and courses- all combined into one\ninteractive and easy to use interface. The student calendar, which shows assignments and due dates for all\ncourses in one easy to use tool, helps students to stay on focus in every course. Courses provide dedicated tools,\nlike a teacher syllabus and announcements, a Raise Your Hand area to ask course-related questions for their\nteachers, easy to use online assessments, and an electronic drop-box for assignment submission. These all work\ntogether to provide a rich course experience for students.\nCourses are delivered by semester. Year-long courses are comprised of two semesters. Courses consist of multiple\nunits, lessons, and activities. Teachers may deliver lectures live or online, but most of the time students work\nthrough expertly designed lessons online which allows students to follow their own personal daily schedules. They\nserve to instruct, to provide practice and exploration and to assess student learning daily, based on a minimum\npace and a schedule that fits each student. Teachers post announcements and indicate the lessons, activities and\nassessments to be completed each week on the course calendar. All work assigned for a single week must be\nreceived on the dates indicated, but may be accepted up until midnight of the Sunday of that week without\npenalty.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy\u2019s Middle and High School program is a blend of synchronous and asynchronous work \u2013\nstudents work according to their own individual daily schedules. Teachers provide asynchronous and synchronous\n\u2013 live support. Course activities may include:\n\u2022 Reading online text and transcripts;\n\u2022 Viewing moving and static images and streaming video;\n\u2022 Listening to audio recordings and pronunciations;\n\u2022 Linear and interactive animations and simulations;\n\u2022 Hands-on and virtual activities;\n\u2022 Threaded discussions with teachers and fellow students in a section, cohort or group;\n\u2022 Teacher announcements;\n\u2022 Online self-check exercises; or\n\u2022 Teacher-created instructional materials\nStudent learning will continue to benefit from close relationships among parents, students, advisors, teachers and\nother support personnel. For students to achieve mastery of high school level courses, the instructional component\nwill rely heavily upon skilled subject-specific teachers who will serve as coaches and guides through a clearly defined,\nhigh-quality curriculum. Learning coaches will still be crucial as mentors and coaches; however, students\u2019 academic\n30\n\nsuccess in virtual high school will depend upon the student\u2019s level of engagement with the curriculum and\ninteractions with their teachers.\n\nStudents are Required to:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nAttend daily sessions virtually and synchronously;\nLog in daily;\nCommunicate with teachers and other staff (school email, IM, phone, etc.);\nFollow course calendar and announcements;\nComplete assignments on (or before) due dates before the end of each day;\nSpend 60-75 minutes in each course each day;\nSubmit assignments on or before the due date directly to their teacher via the \u201cdrop- box\u201d in each course;\nRead teacher feedback and use it to improve their work on future assignments; and\nCommunicate directly with the teacher when they have any questions or problems related to the curriculum,\nor if they need a due date extension.\n\nLearning Coaches at the Middle/High School Level are responsible for:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nConfirming and entering attendance daily;\nEnsuring internet connectivity;\nReporting/resolution of any technical issues or missing materials as quickly as possible;\nEnsuring that students are completing required assignments daily and submitting assignments on time;\nAssisting student with assignments, to the extent that they are comfortable doing so;\nEnsuring that students take advantage of all of the resources available to them to succeed in school; and\nCommunicating with Highpoint teachers when a concern or need presents itself.\n\nLicensed Teachers:\n\nEvery student has an expert teacher for each course. Teachers are state-certified in the subject area they teach, and\nmay be assisted by partner teachers who are experts in a particular curriculum area. Teachers set due dates for\nassignments, and then grade, provide feedback, and return assignments to students. Teachers answer student\nquestions via email and phone, and hold weekly live content sessions during which students and parents can attend\nfor more clarity on difficult topics. Teachers provide one-on-one and small-group instruction to students who are\nexperiencing difficulty with certain topics. Teachers communicate directly with students and Learning Coaches\nregarding the student\u2019s progress and missing/late assignments. Special Education teachers ensure that students with\nIndividual Education Plans (IEPs) receive the accommodations and adaptations required to ensure their success and\ncompliance with their IEP.\n\nMiddle/High School Grading Policies:\n\nGraded activities will be assigned points. A student\u2019s final grade will reflect the actual points earned, compared to the\ntotal points possible. Teachers will use these points to assign letter grades, according to their grading policies.\nStudents and learning coaches can access the current grades for all courses by viewing their accounts in the LMS or\nthe My Info area, at any time during the semester.\nGraded activities may include:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nOnline or paper-based worksheets and practice sets;\nQuizzes;\nExams (e.g. Unit, Semester, Final);\nThreaded-discussions;\n31\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nEssays, research papers, and other writing assignments;\nPresentations\n\nAssignments will be teacher-graded or computer-graded, depending on the assignment. During the semester students\ncan view their grades in the Student Progress Report. Your teachers, administrators and parents also have access to\nyour grade information.\nStudents are responsible for their own work on unit tests and final exams. Students are not allowed to use notes,\nquizzes, or textbooks on unit tests and final exams, unless indicated in an IEP. Students are not allowed to share work\nwith other students on unit tests or final exams. Unless otherwise noted, tests and quizzes are not \u201copen-book\u201d\nassignments. If a student does not complete his own work or shares his work with others on unit tests and/or final\nexams, he/she will not receive credit for the work. He/she will also face the risk of suspension or expulsion.\nStudents must cite sources in all assignments, tests and exams. Students will not receive credit for work that does not\nappropriately cite sources. If a student uses information from a source, but does not cite the source, the student will\nreceive a zero for that assignment and may be suspended or expelled.\n\nLate Work Policy:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nGraded assignments must be completed and submitted no later than midnight on the due date. Teachers\nwill post late work policies in their courses. They may choose to assign a penalty for late work of up to\n20%.\nA zero will be entered the Monday after an assignment is due.\nStudents will be able to submit late assignments after a zero is assigned; however, teachers may choose to\ngive an alternative assignment or award partial points.\nFor computer-scored quizzes that are late, the student will need to contact the teacher before they\nwill be allowed to take the quiz.\nFor computer-scored tests that are late, the learning coach will need to contact the teacher before\nthey will be allowed to retake the test.\n\nTeachers are willing to discuss the late submission of work past the above-listed deadlines. Please contact teachers\ndirectly as soon as possible to find out if this is an option. Teachers will grant due date extensions on assignments\nunder some circumstances. You should never assume that teachers will automatically grant these requests; however,\ndue date extensions must be requested before the due date of the assignment and on a school day. Requests received\non or past the due date, or on a non-school day will most likely not be granted.\n\nSource Citation:\n\nMany courses require written work in which you will need to cite sources. Any direct quotations from your textbook\ncan simply be cited as (author, page number). Any quotations from outside sources require full citations, including\nauthor, title, publisher, date of publication, and page number. If you are citing information found on a website,\nprovide the complete web page or site title, URL, author (if known), page number (if applicable), and publication\ndate of the site (if available).\n\n32\n\nAcademic Dishonesty Policy/Plagiarism:\n\nAcademic integrity is highly valued at Highpoint Virtual Academy. Incidents involving plagiarism and cheating are\nserious offenses that warrant immediate administrative attention. Students are required to submit original work.\nThey are obligated to cite the sources of all references they use. See also Student Rights and Responsibilities Behavior\nGuidelines for additional information regarding this policy.\nNon-citation infraction:\n\u2022 1st incident = grade of zero on assignment\n\u2022 2nd incident = grade of zero on assignment and administrative review.\nCitation infraction\n\u2022 1st incident = counseling on correct use of citations\n\u2022 2nd incident = grade of zero on assignment\n\u2022 3rd incident = grade of zero on assignment and administrative review\nNote: Turnitin.com may be used per teacher request to ensure plagiarism does not occur within assignments.\n\nGrading Scale:\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\n\n4.0\n3.7\n3.3\n3.0\n2.7\n2.3\n\n93-100%\n90-92%\n87-89%\n83-86%\n80-82%\n77-79%\n\nC\nCD+\nD\nDF\n\n2.0\n1.7\n1.3\n1.0\n0.7\n0.0\n\n73-76%\n70-72%\n67-69%\n63-66%\n60-62%\n0-59%\n\nProgress Updates/Report Cards:\n\nStudents in grades 6-12 will receive progress updates via email at the end of Quarters 1 and 3. Report cards will be\nmailed at the end of Quarters 2 and 4 (Semesters 1 and 2).\nHigh School semester grades (Grades 9-12) will be reported on the student\u2019s official transcript.\n\nGrade Appeals:\n\nQuestions regarding all grades should be directed to the Teacher of Record for the course initially to resolve\nquestions. If unresolved, questions should be directed to the Principal for further investigation and final grade\nawarded. The final grade, if changed, will be adjusted on the student transcript by the School Counselor. The Principal\nwill adjust and reissue the report card/transcript if adjustments are made. Grade appeals must be done within 6\nweeks of the end of term.\n\n33\n\nHigh School-Specific Guidelines\nDetermining Class Rank and Honor Roll:\n\nFor students in grades 9-12, class rank is determined by rank ordering the cumulative grade point average of all\nstudents within a grade level. Students earning a semester grade point average of 3.25 or higher will be eligible\nfor the Honor Roll.\nThe following values will be assigned to semester grades in each course:\n\nA\nAB+\nB\n\n4.0\n3.7\n3.3\n3.0\n\nBC+\nC\nC-\n\n2.7\n2.3\n2.0\n1.7\n\nD+\nD\nDF\n\n1.3\n1.0\n0.7\n0.0\n\nCredits and Grade Level Indication:\n\nAll students will be placed in 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grade using the credit scale below:\n0-4.99 Credits \u2013 9th Grade\n5-9.99 Credits \u2013 10th Grade\n10-14.99 Credits \u2013 11th Grade\n15- 22 Credits \u2013 12th Grade\n\nConversion of Credits:\n\nHVAM understands that different schools use different units of measurement for calculating their credits. If a student\ncomes to HVAM and does not have listed the standard 0.5 credit per class per semester the following actions will be\ntaken by the counselors:\n\u2022 The former school will be contacted to verify how their credits are calculated;\n\u2022 Based on the conversation, the counselor will enter credits on the transcript accordingly; and\n\u2022 If it is determined that the student earned less than 0.5 credit because the class was not mastered, the\ncredit will be placed under the \u201cgeneral elective\u201d category and the student will need to take the class\nagain.\n\nWeighted Grade Policy\n\n\u201cWeighting\u201d a grade adds to the grade point value earned in certain courses. Grades earned in weighted classes will\nearn an extra grade point. Therefore, an \u201cA\u201d in a weighted class will yield 5 grade points, a \u201cB\u201d will yield 4 grade\npoints, and a \u201cC\u201d will yield 3 grade, points, etc.\nAdvanced Placement (AP) courses and dual credit courses which are transferable to 4-year colleges or universities and\nare either taught at the high school or university and are part of a sequence which is not available/attainable within\nthe home high school, will be weighted.\nFor students transferring into the District, grades from AP, International Baccalaureate (IB) and dual credit classes will\nbe weighted per the Highpoint GPA scale regardless of previous district GPA points.\n\nHome School Credits:\n\nStudents coming to HVAM from home school will be asked to take a test in each of the core subjects that are listed on\nthe home school transcript. If a student passes the test with at least 60% credit will be awarded.\n34\n\nCredit Recovery:\n\nCredit Recovery classes will be assigned on a case by case basis. Enrollment in a credit recovery class will only occur\nonce the counselor has explained the class format to the student. Both the parent and guardian must sign a form\nunderstanding the pace and intent of the Credit Recovery Course. A student will receive the letter grade earned for\nthe class but the transcript will reflect that the grade was earned through a credit recovery class.\n\nGraduation Requirements:\nHigh School Graduation Requirements\nHighpoint Virtual Academy is accredited by the State of Michigan and is seeking accreditation by AdvancED. As a\nmember of these associations the school must meet the requirements of graduation set up by these organizations,\nthe Michigan State Board of Education, the Michigan State Department of Education, the laws of the state of\nMichigan and the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Trustees.\nCourse Requirements\nHighpoint Virtual Academy will follow the MMC requirements, outlined in the Student Handbook, and as such may be\namended from time to time. In order to be eligible for graduation from Highpoint Virtual Academy, a student must\nhave earned a minimum of 25% of his/her high school credits required for graduation from or complete a minimum of\none (1) full school year (at any time during the student\u2019s education or a combination of time to equal one (1) full\nschool year) as full\u2010time students of Highpoint Virtual Academy. Students may also meet this requirement by\nattending another AdvancEd Accredited Institution for a minimum of one year.\nExceptions may be approved by the Head of School. Under the federal McKinney\u2010Vento Homeless Assistance Act,\nschools are to remove barriers to enrollment for homeless students. Therefore, homeless students are exempted\nfrom the minimum 25% of high school credits earned and a minimum of one full school year at HVAM portions of this\npolicy.\nIn accordance with Michigan Revised School Code 380.1278a and b and Highpoint Virtual Academy academic\nstandards, all students must complete all course requirements.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\n4 Credits \u2013 Math\n4 Credits \u2013 English\n3 Credits \u2013 Social Studies/History to include 0.5 Credits Civics/0.5 Credits Economics\n3 Credits \u2013 Science\n2 Credits \u2013 World Language\n1 Credit Fine Art\n4.0 Credits \u2013 Electives\n0.5 Credits \u2013 Physical Education\n0.5 Credits - Health\n*22 Credits Total\n\nNational Honor Society:\n\nThe Highpoint National Honor Society will offer membership to eligible students between grades 9-11 after the end of the first\nsemester. To be eligible for membership students must meet the following requirements:\n\u2022 Candidates eligible for selection must be in the second semester of ninth grade or members of the tenth or\neleventh grade class.\n35\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nTo be eligible for selection, the candidate must have been enrolled for a period equivalent to one semester at\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan.\nCandidates eligible for selection shall have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.33 on a 4.0 scale.\nUpon meeting the grade level, enrollment, and GPA standards, candidates shall then be considered based on\ntheir service, leadership, character, and citizenship.\n\nGraduation Honors:\n\nDuring the graduation ceremony seniors will be recognized in the following manner: Grade Point Average (rounded to\nthe nearest hundredth.)\n\u2022 Honors cord awarded to students with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher\n\u2022 Medals awarded to Valedictorian and Salutatorian\n\nGraduation Requirements for Seniors:\n\nIf a graduating student wishes to participate in the graduation ceremony, course work must be completed by the\nWednesday prior to graduation. No exceptions will be made. In addition, any student eligible for graduation must\nhave met the following requirements:\n\u2022 Completion of MME testing\n\u2022 Passing of all MMC required classes and at least 22 credits\n\nValedictorian/Salutatorian:\n\nValedictorian: the student in the graduating class that has the highest cumulative GPA.\nSalutatorian: the student in the graduating class that has the second highest cumulative GPA.\nIn order for a student to qualify for Valedictorian/Salutatorian they must meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 Have the highest/second highest GPA\n\u2022 Complete the final year (two semesters) of school at HVAM.\nNote: If there is a tie in GPA for Valedictorian, the student with the highest SAT score will be awarded the\nValedictorian ranking.\n\nReport Cards and Transcripts:\n\nReport cards are mailed out to students at the end of semesters.\nTranscripts are updated at the end of each semester to reflect credits earned. There are two types of transcripts that\na student can request: unofficial transcripts and official transcripts. Unofficial transcripts can be requested of the\nstudents\u2019 counselor or administrator. The counselor will send the transcript to the student or learning coach\nrequesting the transcript. Official transcripts are typically requested by a students\u2019 new school.\nTo request an official transcript be sent to a College or University, please email: hvamtranscripts@highpointva.org.\nPlease include the student\u2019s name, transcript requirements, address and deadlines as appropriate.\n\nSchedule Change Deadline:\n\nChanges to a student\u2019s schedule will only be considered during the first two weeks of the semester or within two\nweeks of a student\u2019s start date. Once the first two weeks have passed, no schedule changes will be considered. A\nrequest for a schedule change does not guarantee that a change will be made. Schedule changes must be in alignment\nwith the student\u2019s EDP and approved by the counselor.\n\n36\n\nRetaking Courses:\n\nStudents failing a course may retake the same course and replace the letter grade and GPA points. Consideration\nshould be make with the counselor to determine overall course numbers and graduation plans/timelines.\n\nHonors Courses:\n\nStudents looking to take more rigorous classes at HVAM are encouraged to take honors classes. Honors Courses\nrequire counselor and/or teacher approval. Once enrolled in an honors class, a student must complete the required\nwork with at least an 80%. If a student does not achieve at least 80% on their semester report card, they will not be\nplaced into an honors class for the next semester.\n\nAdvanced Placement Courses:\n\nHVAM may offer AP courses for 11th and 12th graders. Students will take the AP exam at a high school near them. It is\nthe responsibility of the student to find a school near them where they can take the AP exam, register with that\nschool, and pay for the exam themselves.\n\nMiddle School Students and High School Credit:\n\nMiddle school students may be approved to take high school courses for credit. Only core courses will be considered\nfor credit (no electives). A review of current grades and pre-requisites will be conducted and an assessment may be\ngiven to determine appropriateness of placement.\n\nForeign Languages:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that students show strong English Language Arts success at the 8th grade level to be\napproved for foreign language placement in the 9th grade. (A/B grade marks or administrative approval.) Foreign\nLanguage classes should be considered Independent Study although a licensed teacher will be available for instruction\nand support.\n\nTesting Out:\n\nAny high school student who wishes to test-out of a core graduation required course may do so by taking the School\nFinal Exam. The student must receive a grade of at least C+ (77%) or by demonstrating mastery of the subject matter\nas determined by the assessment used in lieu of a final examination. Credit will be awarded as Pass/Fail and will not\nimpact overall GPA. Students who opt to Test Out shall receive a syllabus for the course they are testing out and State\nContent Expectation Standards, if available. This is done in accordance to the Michigan Merit Curriculum law\n380.1278(a)(4)(c) and 380.1279(b) of the Revised School code.\n\nPersonal Curriculum:\n\nAccording to Section 380.1278 of the Revised School code, general education students have a right to a personal\ncurriculum if doing so will allow them to graduate high school in a timely manner with a diploma. The PC is a process\nto modify specific credit requirements and/or content expectations based on the individual learning needs of a\nstudent. It is designed to serve students who want to accelerate or go beyond the MMC requirements and students\nwho need to individualize learning requirements to meet the MMC requirements. A personal curriculum can be\nimplemented in the following areas:\n\u2022 Modify the Algebra II content\n\u2022 Go beyond the academic credit requirements by adding more math, science, English Language Arts, or world\nlanguage credits in place of Health, PE, VFPA, or Social Studies.\n\u2022 Modify credit requirements for a student who transfers from out of state or from a nonpublic school in the\n11th or 12th grade and is unable to meet the MMC requirements.\n37\n\nIf a student is interested in a personal curriculum, the follows steps will be followed:\n\u2022 Parent, student, or school personnel requests a PC\n\u2022 Request is reviewed to determine if a PC is needed\n\u2022 PC team meets, including student, parent, counselor, and teacher of related subject area that will be modified\n\u2022 An agreement is written and signed by the PC team as well as the school principal or head of school\n\u2022 PC is implemented\n\u2022 Progress is monitored by the school and the PC counselor\nUpon completion of the PC and all other high school classes, the student is awarded a high school diploma.\n\nCertificate of Completion:\n\nA Certificate of Completion recognizes the accomplishments of students who have completed a district- prescribed\ncourse of study outside of the Michigan Merit Curriculum. This certificate recognizes the achievement of transition\ngoals outlined in the student\u2019s IEP that promote post-secondary independence to the degree that meets the\nindividual student\u2019s capabilities. A Certificate of Completion is an educational alternative to the diploma-bound course\nof study at HVAM, emphasizing functional academics, life management, social and behavioral skills development, and\nvocational/employment training in order for students to become happy, healthy and productive adults. Parents and\nGuardians with questions should reach out to their student\u2019s Special Education teacher.\n\nDual Enrollment:\n\nHVAM allows students to take Dual Enrollment courses but must meet the following guidelines:\n\u2022 Students/LC\u2019s must consult with their counselors first to determine eligibility for dual enrollment.\nEligibility Requirements:\n\u2022 Have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5.\n\u2022 Must have taken at least one of the state tests (PSAT, ACT, SAT).\n\u2022 Must be passing current courses at the time of the application\n\u2022 Must take all testing required by HVAM\n\u2022 Students must be enrolled in at least 1 Highpoint Course to be considered an HVAM student.\nAdditional Guidelines:\n\nThe number of postsecondary dual enrollment courses that a pupil may take it limited to not more than 10\ncourses overall.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe postsecondary courses must be academic in nature or applicable to career preparation.\nThe postsecondary course must apply toward the satisfaction of degree requirements and may not be in the\nsubject areas of physical education, theology, divinity or religious education. Hobby craft and recreational\ncourses are not eligible under legislation.\nAn eligible postsecondary course must not be offered by the school district.\n\nSchool counselor and administration reserve the right to deny or allow student\u2019s participation in dual enrollment.\nStudents/Learning Coaches/ and school administration will all sign a dual enrollment contract/document agreeing to\nthe above items. The school has a set amount of funds set aside for dual enrollment tuition. If there is a balance left\nafter the school has sent the prorated amount, the student/family is responsible for the outstanding fee. If a student\ndrops out of DE course(s) after the college\u2019s official dropout date, he/she is responsible for refunding the amount\nused for tuition back to HVAM. The student must follow ALL of the college\u2019s and HVAM\u2019s important academic dates.\n38\n\nCommitting plagiarism or any other academic infraction is automatic grounds for withdrawal from dual enrollment\nand will make student ineligible for dual enrollment while actively enrolled at Highpoint.\nEarly Middle College:\nThe Highpoint Early Middle College program offers students the opportunity to earn an Associate\u2019s Degree at NO cost.\nStudents who are enrolling must have a 2.50 GPA, are on track for graduation, and have less than 10 absences per\nschool year. Students in this program will take high school and college courses during their junior and senior year.\nStudents will then attend college courses only for a 13th year and earn their high school diploma and an Associate\u2019s\ndegree simultaneously.\nStudents who are interested in these courses should be looking into them as early as 8th and 9th grades so that they\nwill be prepared when the time comes for enrollment. The counselor or principal will discuss programs with students.\n\nIncompletes:\n\nA mark of incomplete indicates that the required work for the course has not been completed. Any incomplete for a\nfirst semester grade shall be made up no later than two weeks into the second semester. Any incomplete for a second\nsemester grade shall be made up no later than one week after school is dismissed for summer break. Failure to do so\nwill may result in an automatic F and loss of one semester of credit for that class.\n\nGraduating Early/Number of Courses:\n\nStudents at HVAM take 6 courses each semester. However, HVAM recognizes that there are times when taking more\nthan 6 courses during a given semester/school year will allow a student to graduate early or on time. If such an\nincident occurs, it is at the discretion of the counselor to determine if the student is able to handle more than 6\nclasses at a time. Only students in grades 11 and 12 will be considered for more than 6 classes each semester\n(maximum of 8). Please note: if a student wishes to graduate early, he or she will need to apply for early graduation\nand be approved by the counseling department and administration.\n\nHealth Class\n\nHigh School students are required to take a health class in order to meet the requirements of the Michigan Merit\nCurriculum and graduate.

Discipline\nproblems are best resolved expediently and closest to their source by the parties most directly involved. Most\ndiscipline issues are resolved with minimal administrative intervention. In the best interests of the student and the\nschool, several disciplinary options are available.\n\nDiscipline Appeal:\n\nIn the event the student and parent(s), custodian(s), or legal guardian(s) disagrees with any disciplinary measures\nthey should address, in writing, any concern or grievance to the Head of School. The Head of School responds within\nten (10) working days. If the concern or grievance is not resolved by the Head of School, the parent(s), custodian(s),\nor legal guardian(s) may, within ten (10) working days of the Head of School\u2019s response, request a meeting (via\nphone or in person) with the Head of School to discuss the concern or grievance. The Head of School shall\ninvestigate and respond within ten (10) working days. If the family\u2019s concern is not resolved at the meeting with the\nHead of School, the family may file a complaint with the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Directors.\n\nProcedures for Suspensions of 3 Days or Less:\n\nStudents who are suspended shall be afforded a conference with the administrator of the department before being\nsuspended. During the conference, the student shall be:\n\u2022 Informed of the alleged violation and any of the surrounding circumstances examined;\n\u2022 Given an opportunity to respond to the accusations if he/she has not already done so;\n\u2022 Informed of the recommended remedial measure; and\n\u2022 Informed of the consequences of future infractions.\nAfter the conference with the student, the administrator shall implement the recommended remedial measure and\nsend the parent a disciplinary letter to inform them of the student\u2019s violation, the length of the suspension, and the\nday on which the student and parent/guardian are permitted to return to class.\n\nProcedure for Suspensions of More than 3 Days:\n\nStudents who are suspended for more than 3 days shall be afforded an informal hearing. Parents/guardian(s) of the\nstudents must be notified in writing when the suspension is between 3 and 10 days. The notification must afford the\nparent time to attend the hearing. When the suspension is in regards to health, safety and welfare the student may\nbe suspended immediately. The hearing allows the students to meet with the appropriate official(s) to explain why\nhe/she should not be suspended. During the hearing the student will be:\n\u2022 Informed of the alleged violation and any of the surrounding circumstances examined;\n\u2022 Given an opportunity to respond to the accusations if he/she has not already done so;\n\u2022 Informed of the recommended remedial measure; and\n\u2022 Informed of the consequences of future infractions.\n\nExpulsion:\nBy definition, expulsion is any exclusion from school for a period of more than 10 days. Written notice describing\nthe misconduct and containing specific reference to the rules and setting the time and place of the hearing must be\nsent to the student\u2019s parent or guardian. A formal hearing must be held and should be private unless requested by\n44\n\nthe parent or guardian to be public. The student:\n\u2022 May be represented by an attorney;\n\u2022 Has the right to have the information on the prosecution\u2019s witnesses;\n\u2022 Has the right to testify and present witnesses on his/her own behalf; and\n\u2022 Has the right to appeal to the appropriate judicial authority\n\nDiscipline of Students with Disabilities\n\nIf a student violates the Code of Student Conduct, before consequences or punishment are imposed, it must be\nconsidered whether the student has a disability evidenced by evaluation documents current or pending. While all\nstudents may be disciplined, it is unjust to punish a child when the offense is directly related to his/her disability or\nwhen the IEP is not implemented. Disciplinary actions give students with disabilities extra legal protections when the\ndiscipline constitutes a change in placement.\nA \u201cchange in placement\u201d is a legal term that applies to the following situations:\n\u2022 The removal is for more than 10 consecutive days; or\n\u2022 The student has been subjected to a series of suspensions that constitute a pattern\nIf the offense and subsequent suspensions do not exceed 10 consecutive days nor constitute a pattern or\nsuspensions using the Documentation of Pattern planning form, then it is not a change in placement and the student\nmay be subject to the same consequence that applies to all students who violate the Code of Student Conduct.\nIf the offense is a change in placement, the school team (including the parent or guardian) must hold a\nManifestation Determination Review meeting within 10 days of the decision to remove the student to\ndetermine two issues:\n\u2022 Was the student\u2019s misconduct caused by or directly and substantially related to the student\u2019s disability; or\n\u2022 Was the student\u2019s misconduct a direct result of the school\u2019s failure to follow the child\u2019s IEP?\nThe parent/guardian must be provided a copy of the Special Education Procedural safeguards. If the team answers\n\u201cyes\u201d to either question, then the student\u2019s behavior is a manifestation of his or her disability. The student may not\nbe suspended, expelled or transferred to a remedial disciplinary school as a punishment for misbehavior. The team\nmust conduct a functional behavioral assessment and create a behavior plan addressing ways that the school can\nhelp a student with the conduct at issue. If the student already has a behavior plan, the plan must be reviewed and\nmodified to address how the school can better assist the student with the conduct at issue.\nIf all team members agree that the student\u2019s conduct was not a manifestation of his disability, then the student\nmay be subject to the same consequences as all students. However, during the period of expulsion or transfer to\nan alternative placement or remedial disciplinary setting, the student must continue to receive special education\nservices prescribed by his IEP and a Behavior Plan must be created or revised to address the offending conduct.\nIf a student:\n\u2022 Possesses illegal drugs;\n\u2022 Is selling prescription drugs;\n\u2022 Carries a weapon; or\n\u2022 Causes serious bodily injury to another either at school or during a school related activity.\nThe school may immediately remove the student for up to forty-five (45) school days to an alternative or remedial\ndisciplinary setting because drugs, weapons, and serious bodily injury are so dangerous to a safe school regardless of\n45\n\nwhether a child has a disability or even if the team believes that the behavior is a manifestation of the student\u2019s\ndisability.\nTo comply with the law, a 45 school day emergency removal for serious bodily injury must be serious, i.e. requiring\nmedical treatment, etc. During the forty-five (45) school day period, the school must convene a manifestation\ndetermination meeting. If the school determines that the conduct is a manifestation, the school may have the child\nre-evaluated, create or revise an existing behavior plan, or hold an IEP meeting to consider a more intensive special\neducation placement upon the expiration of the 45 day alternative placement or sooner. If all team members\ndetermine that the conduct was not a manifestation of the student\u2019s disability, then the 45 school day emergency\nplacement may proceed to a disciplinary proceeding afforded to all students.\nIf the parent or guardian disagrees with the team\u2019s decision that the behavior was not a manifestation of the\nstudent\u2019s disability, the parent or guardian may request a due process hearing to challenge this finding. If the\nhearing officer agrees with the parent or guardian, the student will remain in the school where the offense was\ncommitted unless the parent or guardian and the school agree otherwise.\n\nEmergency Hearing for Dangerousness\n\nIf a school has solid reasons to believe that keeping the student in his current school is \u201csubstantially likely to result\nin injury to the child or others\u201d, the school will consult with the Special Programs Director who may request an\nemergency hearing to ask a hearing officer to transfer the student to an alternative setting for up to 45 school days.\nDangerousness may exist even if there is no Code of Conduct violation. It is a consideration based on serious safety\nconcerns for the student and/or the school community.\n\nBullying and Cyber Bullying\nThe Board of Directors of Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan has approved the following anti- bullying\npolicy:\n\nMICHIGAN STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Anti-Bullying Policy\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education recognizes that a school that is physically and\nemotionally safe and secure for all students promotes good citizenship, increases student attendance and\nengagement, and supports academic achievement. To protect the rights of all students and groups for a safe and\nsecure learning environment, the Board of Education prohibits acts of bullying, harassment, and other forms of\naggression and violence. Bullying or harassment, like other forms of aggressive and violent behaviors, interferes\nwith both a school\u2019s ability to educate its students and a student\u2019s ability to learn. All administrators, faculty, staff,\nparents, volunteers, and students are expected to refuse to tolerate bullying and harassment and to demonstrate\nbehavior that is respectful and civil. It is especially important for adults to model these behaviors (even when\ndisciplining) in order to provide positive examples for student behavior.\n\u201cBullying\u201d or \u201charassment\u201d is any gesture or written, verbal, graphic, or physical act (including electronically\ntransmitted acts \u2013 i.e., cyberbullying, through the use of internet, cell phone, personal digital assistant (pda),\ncomputer, or wireless handheld device, currently in use or later developed and used by students) that is reasonably\nperceived as being dehumanizing, intimidating, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or otherwise likely to evoke fear of\nphysical harm or emotional distress and may be motivated either by bias or prejudice based upon any actual or\nperceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender\nidentity or expression; or a mental, physical, or sensory disability or impairment; or by any other distinguishing\n46\n\ncharacteristic, or is based upon association with another person who has or is perceived to have any distinguishing\ncharacteristic. Bullying and harassment also include forms of retaliation against individuals who report or cooperate\nin an investigation under this policy. Such behaviors are considered to be bullying or harassment whether they take\nplace on or off school property, at any school-sponsored function, or in a school vehicle or at any time or place\nwhere a child\u2019s imminent safety or over-all well-being may be at issue.\n\u201cBullying\u201d is conduct that meets all of the following criteria:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIs reasonably perceived as being dehumanizing, intimidating, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or\notherwise likely to evoke fear of physical harm or emotional distress;\nIs directed at one or more pupils;\nIs conveyed through physical, verbal, technological or emotional means;\nSubstantially interferes with educational opportunities, benefits, or programs of one or more pupils;\nAdversely affects the ability of a pupil to participate in or benefit from the school district\u2019s or public school\u2019s\neducational programs or activities by placing the pupil in reasonable fear of physical harm or by causing\nemotional distress; and,\nIs based on a pupil\u2019s actual or perceived distinguishing characteristic (see above), or is based on an\nassociation with another person who has or is perceived to have any of these characteristics.\n\n\u201cHarassment\u201d is conduct that meets all of the following criteria:\n\u2022 Is reasonably perceived as being dehumanizing, intimidating, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or\notherwise likely to evoke fear of physical harm or emotional distress;\n\u2022 Is directed at one or more pupils;\n\u2022 Is conveyed through physical, verbal, technological or emotional means;\n\u2022 Substantially interferes with educational opportunities, benefits, or programs of one or more pupils;\n\u2022 Adversely affects the ability of a pupil to participate in or benefit from the school district\u2019s or public\nschool\u2019s educational programs or activities because the conduct, as reasonably perceived by the pupil,\nis so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive as to have this effect; and,\n\u2022 is based on a pupil\u2019s actual or perceived distinguishing characteristic (see above), or is based on an\nassociation with another person who has or is perceived to have any of these characteristics.\nThe scope of this policy includes the prohibition of every form of bullying, harassment, and\ncyberbullying/harassment, whether in the classroom, on school premises, immediately adjacent to school\npremises, when a student is traveling to or from school (portal to portal), or at a school-sponsored event, whether\nor not held on school premises. Bullying or harassment, including cyberbullying/ harassment, that is not initiated at\na location defined above is covered by this policy if the incident results in a potentially material or substantial\ndisruption of the school learning environment for one or more students and/or the orderly day-to-day operations\nof any school or school program.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education expects students to conduct themselves in a\nmanner in keeping with their levels of development, maturity, and demonstrated capabilities with a proper regard\nfor the rights and welfare of other students, school staff, volunteers, and contractors.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education believes that a comprehensive health education\ncurriculum, within a coordinated school health framework, helps students attain knowledge and skills vital to\nschool success, a productive workforce and good citizenship. Critical skills include anticipating consequences of\n47\n\nchoices, making informed decisions, communicating effectively, resolving conflicts, and developing cultural\ncompetency.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education recognizes that in order to have the maximum\nimpact, it is critical to provide a minimum of annual training for school employees and volunteers who have\nsignificant contact with pupils on school policies and procedures regarding bullying and harassment. Training will\nprovide school employees with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities and the necessary skills to\nfulfill them.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education believes that standards for student behavior must\nbe set through interaction among the students, parents and guardians, staff, and community members of the\nschool district, producing an atmosphere that encourages students to grow in self-discipline and their ability to\nrespect the rights of others. The development of this atmosphere requires respect for self and others, as well as\nfor district and community property on the part of students, staff, parents, and community members.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education believes that the best discipline for aggressive\nbehavior is designed to:\n\u2022 Support students in taking responsibility for their actions;\n\u2022 Develop empathy; and\n\u2022 Teach alternative ways to achieve the goals and the solve problems that motivated the aggressive behavior.\nStaff members who interact with students shall apply best practices designed to prevent discipline problems and\nencourage students\u2019 abilities to develop self-discipline and make better choices in the future.\nSince bystander support of bullying and harassment can encourage these behaviors, the district prohibits both\nactive and passive support for acts of harassment or bullying. The staff should encourage students not to be part of\nthe problem; not to pass on the rumor or derogatory message; to walk away from these acts when they see them;\nto constructively attempt to stop them; to report them to the designated authority; and to reach out in friendship\nto the target. Periodic classroom meetings should be conducted to teach bystanders how and when to respond to\nbullying and harassment incidents. Informal classroom discussions and activities designed to provide awareness and\nincrease student connectedness promote a positive shift in peer norms that will support empowered bystanders.\nWhen bystanders do report or cooperate in an investigation, they must be protected from retaliation with the same\ntype of procedures used to respond to bullying and harassment.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education requires its school administrators to develop and\nimplement procedures that ensure both the appropriate consequences and remedial responses to a student or\nstaff member who commits one or more acts of bullying and harassment. The following factors, at a minimum,\nshall be given full consideration by school administrators in the development of the procedures for determining\nappropriate consequences and remedial measures for each act of harassment or bullying.\nFactors for Determining Consequences\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nAge, development, and maturity levels of the parties involved;\nDegree of harm (physical and/or emotional distress);\nSurrounding circumstances;\nNature and severity of the behavior(s);\n\n48\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIncidents of past or continuing pattern(s) of behavior;\nRelationship between the parties involved; or\nContext in which the alleged incident(s) occurred\n\nNote: In order to ensure students\u2019 perception of fair and impartial treatment, a student\u2019s academic or athletic\nstatus is not a legitimate factor for determining consequences. Consequences must be perceived as fair and\nimpartial.\nFactors for Determining Remedial Measures\nPersonal\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nLife skill competencies\nExperiential deficiencies\nSocial relationships\nStrengths\nTalents\nTraits\nInterests\nHobbies\nExtra-curricular activities\nClassroom participation\nAcademic performance\n\nEnvironmental\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nSchool culture\nSchool climate and lack of connectedness\nStudent-staff relationships and staff behavior toward the student\nLevel of consistency in staff responses to bullying or harassing behaviors\nLevel of consistency in application or severity of consequences given to students\nStaff-staff relationships witnessed by students\nGeneral staff management of classrooms and other educational environments\nStaff ability to prevent and de-escalate difficult or inflammatory situations\nSocial-emotional and behavioral supports\nSocial relationships\nCommunity activities\nNeighborhood culture\nFamily situation\nRange and number of opportunities for student engagement, involvement, and recognition for achievement\n(beyond academics and athletics)\n\nConsequences and appropriate remedial actions for a student or staff member who engages in one or more acts\nof bullying or harassment may range from positive behavioral interventions up to and including suspension or\nexpulsion, in the case of a student, or suspension or termination in the case of an employee, as set forth in the\nBoard of Education\u2019s approved Code of Student Conduct or Employee Handbook. School employees will also be\nheld accountable for bullying or harassing behavior directed toward school employees, volunteers, parents, or\n49\n\nstudents.\nConsequences for a student who commits an act of bullying and harassment shall vary in method and severity\naccording to the nature of the behavior, the developmental age of the student, and the student\u2019s history of\nproblem behaviors and performance, and must be consistent with the Board of Education\u2019s approved Code of\nStudent Conduct. Remedial measures shall be designed to: correct the problem behavior; prevent another\noccurrence of the behavior; and protect the victim of the act. Effective discipline should employ a school-wide\napproach to adopt a rubric of bullying offenses and the associated consequences. The consequences and\nremedial measures may include, but are not limited to, the examples listed below:\nExamples of Consequences\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nAdmonishment\nParticipation in a guided reflection process designed to teach alternative behavior\nTemporary removal from the classroom\nLoss of privileges\nReferral to disciplinarian\nOut-of-school suspension\nLegal action\nExpulsion or termination\n\nExamples of Remedial Measures\nStrategies for Individual Behavioral Change:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nFraming the aggressive behavior as a failed attempt to solve a real problem or reach a goal.

All school\nemployees are required to report alleged violations of this policy to the principal or the principal\u2019s designee. All\nother members of the school community, including students, parents, volunteers, and visitors, are encouraged to\nreport any act that may be a violation of this policy.\nReports may be made anonymously, but formal disciplinary action may not be based solely on the basis of an\nanonymous report.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Board of Education requires the principal and/or the principal\u2019s\ndesignee to be responsible for determining whether an alleged act constitutes a violation of this policy. In so\ndoing, the principal and/or the principal\u2019s designee shall conduct a prompt, thorough, and complete investigation\nof each alleged incident. The investigation is to be completed within three school days after a report or complaint\nis made.

Informal reports may be made\nto any staff member, although staff shall always inform complainants of their right to, and the process for, filing a\nformal complaint. Staff shall also direct potential complaints to an appropriate staff member who can explain the\ninformal and formal complaint process and what a complainant can expect. Staff shall also inform an appropriate\nsupervisor or designated staff person when they receive complaints of harassment, intimidation, or bullying,\nespecially when the complaint is beyond their training to resolve or alleges serious misconduct.\nInformal remedies include an opportunity for the complainant(s) to explain to the alleged perpetrator that the\nconduct is unwelcome, disruptive, or inappropriate either in writing or face-to-face; a statement from a staff\nmember to the alleged perpetrator that the alleged conduct is not appropriate and could lead to discipline if proven\nor repeated; or a general public statement from an administrator reviewing the school harassment, intimidation\nand bullying policy without identifying the complainant, parent, guardian, or because Highpoint Virtual Academy of\nMichigan believes the complaint needs to be more thoroughly investigated.\n\nFormal Complaint Process\nAnyone may initiate a formal complaint of harassment, intimidation or bullying, even if the informal complaint\nprocess is being utilized. Complainant(s) should not be promised confidentiality at the onset of an investigation. It\ncannot be predicted what will be discovered or what kind of hearing may result. Efforts will be made to increase the\nconfidence and trust of the person making the complaint. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will fully\nimplement the anti-retaliation provisions of this policy to protect complainant(s) and witnesses. Student\ncomplainants and witnesses may have a parent/guardian with them, if requested, during any school initiated\ninvestigatory activities. The Head of School or designated compliance officer (hereinafter referred to as the\n\u201ccompliance officer\u201d) may conclude that the school needs to conduct an investigation based on information in their\npossession regardless of the complainant\u2019s interest in filing a formal complaint.

An assessment for the lesson must\nbe completed to show that the objectives have been met.\n\nStudent Records\n\nStudent records are maintained at the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan office. The Highpoint Virtual\nAcademy of Michigan provides parents/guardians access to the academic records of their children. The access\nrights of parent/guardian consist of:\n\u2022 The right to inspect and review the contents of educational records.\n\u2022 The right to obtain one copy of the education records at no charge, and additional copies, if\n\n57\n\nrequested, at a charge. These will be stamped as \u201cunofficial.\u201d\n\u2022 The right to receive from school personnel an explanation and interpretation of the\neducational records.\n\u2022 The right to a hearing to challenge the contents of the educational records.\n\u2022 The right to bring an attorney or parent/guardian advocate to review educational records.\nA parent or guardian seeking access to the educational records may make a request by telephone or in person\nto the Head of School or designee. However, prior to reviewing and inspecting the educational records, a\nparent or guardian must sign an official request form. Access to educational records is granted within forty-five\ndays of the receipt of the written request.\nAfter examining their child's educational record, parents/guardian(s) may request a hearing to challenge the\ncontents of the record. The purpose of the hearing is to establish the accuracy of the record. At an informal\nmeeting between the parent/guardian and the Site Administrator or designee, an attempt is made to answer any\nquestions raised by the parent/guardian. If the questions are not resolved, a formal hearing is conducted in the\noffice of the Head of School.\nIn general, the school may not permit access to, nor release of, educational records to third parties without the\nconsent of the child\u2019s parents or guardians. However, educational records may be released without the consent of\nparent/guardian to another public school system to which a pupil transfers. Pupil directory information, which\nincludes: the pupil's name; address; date and place of birth; photographic likeness; major field of study; dates of\nattendance; degrees and awards received; and participation in officially recognized activities and sports may be\nreleased without the consent of the parent/guardian unless the school is notified annually by the parent/guardian\nnot to release the information without their prior written consent.

Records containing personally identifiable information about or related to children with disabilities\ncould include, but are not limited to: cumulative grade reports, discipline records, enrollment and attendance\nrecords, health records, individualized education programs, notices of recommended assignment, notices of intent\nto evaluate and to reevaluate, comprehensive evaluation reports, other evaluation reports by public school staff\nand by outside evaluators, work samples, test data, data entered into the data system, correspondence between\nschool staff and home, instructional support team documents, referral data, memoranda and other educationrelated documents. Records can be maintained electronically, on paper, microfiche, audio and videotape.\nRecords can be located in the central administrative offices of the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan,\nelectronic storage systems and in the secure possession of teachers, school administrators, specialists,\npsychologists, counselors and other school staff with a legitimate educational interest in the information contained\ntherein. All records are maintained in the strictest confidentiality.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents and students (when they turn) 18 years of age\nor older (\"eligible students\") certain rights with respect to the student's education records. These rights are:\n1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan receives a request for access.\nParents or eligible students who wish to inspect their child\u2019s or their education records should submit to\nthe school principal [or appropriate school official] a written request that identifies the records they\nwish to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible\nstudent of the time and place where the records may be inspected.\n2. The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the parent or eligible\nstudent believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student\u2019s privacy rights\nunder FERPA.\nParents or eligible students who wish to ask Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan to amend their\nchild\u2019s or their education record should write the school principal [or appropriate school official],\nclearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the\nschool decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent or eligible student, the school will\nnotify the parent or eligible student of the decision and of their right to a hearing regarding the request\nfor amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the\nparent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.\n3. The right to provide written consent before the school discloses personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA\nauthorizes disclosure without consent.\nOne exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with\nlegitimate educational interests. The criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what\nconstitutes a legitimate educational interest must be set forth in the school\u2019s or school district\u2019s annual\nnotification for FERPA rights. A school official typically includes a person employed by the school or\nschool district as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or\nmedical staff and law enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the school board. A school\nofficial also may include a volunteer, contractor, or consultant who, while not employed by the school,\nperforms an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own\nemployees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance\n59\n\nof PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; a parent or\nstudent volunteering to serve on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee;\nor a parent, student, or other volunteer assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.\nA school official typically has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an\neducation record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\nUpon request, the school discloses education records without consent to officials of another school\nor school district in which a student seeks or intends to enroll, or is already enrolled if the disclosure\nis for purposes of the student\u2019s enrollment or transfer.\n4.

(McKinney - Vento Homeless Act)\n\nMcKinney-Vento/ Homeless Student Liaison\nJulia Zoutendyk\n855-337-8243 X 7008\njzoutendyk@highpointva.org\n\nDefinition: The Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan defines any homeless children and youth according to the\nFederal McKinney-Vento Homeless Definition, as individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime\n\n64\n\nresidence.\nThe term includes children and youth who are:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nSharing housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason;\nLiving in emergency or transitional shelters;\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nAbandoned in hospitals;\nAwaiting foster care placement;\nChildren and youth who have a primary residence that is a public or private place not designed for, or\nordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings;\nChildren and youth who are living in cars, parks, pubic space, abandoned buildings, substandard\nhousing, bus or train stations, or similar settings; and\nMigratory children who qualify as homeless because they are living in circumstances described\nabove.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nHomeless Children and Youth Services\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will ensure that homeless students are provided services including but not\nlimited to the following:\nA. transportation services;\nB. public preschool programs and other educational programs and services for which the homeless student\nmeets eligibility criteria including:\n\u2022 programs for children with disabilities;\n\u2022 programs for English Learners (ELs) (i.e., students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP);\n\u2022 programs in career and technical education;\n\u2022 programs for gifted and talented students;\n\u2022 school nutrition programs; and\n\u2022 before - and after-school programs.\nThe Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Liaison for Homeless Children and Youth is, Mary Moorman. Ms.\nMoorman will coordinate and collaborate with the State Coordinator for the Education of Homeless Children and\nYouth as well as with community and school personnel responsible for the provision of education and related services\nto homeless children and youths.\nMaintaining a Stable School Environment\nTo ensure stability for homeless students, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will make school placement\ndeterminations based on the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the homeless student based on student-centered factors. The\nAcademy will:\n1.) continue the student\u2019s education in the school of origin for the duration of homelessness when a family\nbecomes homeless between academic years or during an academic year; and for the remainder of the\nacademic year even if the child or youth becomes permanently housed during an academic year; or\n2.) enroll the student in any public school that non-homeless students who live in the attendance area in which\nthe child or youth is actually living are eligible to attend.\nWhen determining a student\u2019s best interest, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will assume that keeping the\nhomeless student in the school of origin is in that student\u2019s best interest, except when doing so is contrary to the\n\n65\n\nrequest of the student\u2019s parent or guardian, or the student if he or she is an unaccompanied youth. The school of\norigin is the school the student attended or enrolled in when permanently housed, including a public preschool. The\nschool of origin also includes the designated receiving school at the next level for feeder school patterns, when the\nstudent completes the final grade level at the school of origin.\nWhen determining the student\u2019s best interest, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will also consider studentcentered factors, including the impact of mobility on achievement, education, health, and safety of homeless students\nand give priority to the request of the student\u2019s parent or guardian, or youth (if an unaccompanied youth). Highpoint\nVirtual Academy of Michigan also considers the school placement of siblings when making this determination.\nIf Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan finds that it is not in the student\u2019s best interest to attend the school of origin\nor the school requested by the parent or guardian, or unaccompanied youth, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\nwill provide the individual with a written explanation and reason for the determination in a manner and form\nunderstandable to the parent, guardian or unaccompanied youth. This written explanation will include appeal rights\nand be provided in a timely manner.\nImmediate Enrollment for Homeless Students\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan has an obligation to remove barriers to the enrollment and retention of\nhomeless students. A school chosen on the basis of a best interest determination shall enroll the homeless student,\neven if the student does not have the documentation typically necessary for enrollment, such as immunization and\nother required health records, proof of residency, proof of guardianship, birth certificate or previous academic\nrecords. The homeless student shall be enrolled immediately regardless of whether the student missed application or\nenrollment deadlines during the period of homelessness or has outstanding fines or fees.\nThe enrolling school shall contact the school last attended by the homeless student to obtain relevant academic or\nother records. If the student needs immunization or other health records, the enrolling school shall refer the parent,\nguardian or unaccompanied youth to the local liaison, who will help obtain the immunizations, screenings or other\nrequired health records. Records usually maintained by the school must be kept so that they are available in a timely\nfashion if the child enters a new school or Academy. These records include immunization or other required health\nrecords, academic records, birth certificates, guardianship records, and evaluations for special services or programs.\nProcedures for inter-State records transfer between schools should be taken into account in order to facilitate\nimmediate enrollment.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will also make sure that, once identified for services, the homeless student is\nattending classes and not facing barriers to accessing academic and extracurricular activities, including magnet school,\nsummer school, career and technical education, advanced placement, online learning, and charter school programs (if\navailable). In addition, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may consider giving homeless children and youth\u2019s\npriority if there is a waitlist for these schools, programs, and activities.\nTransportation Services for Homeless Students\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will provide homeless students with transportation services that are\ncomparable to those available to non-homeless students. Additionally, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will\nprovide for, or arrange for transportation to and from the school of origin at the parent or guardian\u2019s request, or the\nliaison\u2019s request in the case of an unaccompanied youth. Transportation is arranged promptly to allow for immediate\nenrollment and will not create barriers to a homeless student\u2019s attendance, retention, and success. The following\nprocedures also apply subject to a determination of the student's best interest:\n66\n\n1.) If the homeless student moves but continues to live within the area covered by the Academy's charter the\nAcademy is considered the school of origin and the school of residence and, therefore, transportation will be\nprovided or arranged for the student\u2019s transportation to or from the school of origin by the Academy.\n2.) If the homeless student moves to an area outside of the Academy's charter, though continuing his/her\neducation at the school of origin, the Academy and the public school district in which the student resides\nmust agree upon a method to apportion responsibility and costs for transportation to the school of origin. If\nthe Academy and the public school district cannot agree upon such a method, the responsibility and costs will\nbe shared equally.\n3.) When the student obtains permanent housing, transportation shall be provided to and from the school of\norigin until the end of the school year.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan shall determine the mode of transportation in consultation with the parent or\nguardian based on the best interest of the student.\nIn accordance with Federal law, the above transportation requirements still apply during the resolution of any\ndispute. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will work with the State to resolve transportation disputes with other\nAcademies. If the disputing Academy is in another State, the Academy will turn to the State for assistance as Federal\nguidance says that both States should try to arrange an agreement for the Academies.\nDispute Resolution Procedure\nHomeless families and youths have the right to challenge placement and enrollment decisions. If a dispute arises\nbetween a school and a parent, guardian or unaccompanied youth regarding eligibility, school selection, or enrollment\nof a homeless student, the Academy must follow its dispute resolution procedures, consistent with the State\u2019s\nprocedures. If such a dispute occurs, the Academy will immediately enroll the homeless student in the school in which\nenrollment is sought pending final resolution of the dispute, including all appeals. The student will receive all services\nfor which they are eligible until all disputes and appeals are resolved.\nPursuant to State, Academy and Board of Directors policies, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will provide the\nparent, guardian or unaccompanied youth with a written explanation of all decisions regarding school selection and\nenrollment made by the Academy or State, along with a written explanation of appeal rights.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\u2019s notice and written explanation about the reason for its decision will include,\nat a minimum, an explanation of how the school reached its decision regarding eligibility, school selection, or\nenrollment, including 1) a description of the proposed or refused action by the school, 2) an explanation of why the\naction is proposed or refused, 3) a description of other options the school considered and why those options were\nrejected, 4) a description of any other relevant factors to the school\u2019s decision and information related to the\neligibility or best interest determination such as the facts, witnesses, and evidence relied upon and their sources, and\n5) an appropriate timeline to ensure deadlines are not missed. The Academy must also include contact information\nfor the Liaison and the State Coordinator, and a brief description of their roles. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\nwill also refer the parent, guardian or unaccompanied youth to the Liaison, who will carry out the dispute resolution\nprocess.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan ensures that all decisions and notices are drafted in a language and format\nappropriate for low-literacy, limited vision readers, and individuals with disabilities. For children and youth and/or\nparents or guardians who are English learners or whose dominate language is not English, the Academy will provide\ntranslation and interpretation services in connection with all phases of the dispute resolution process pursuant to\nfederal laws. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will also provide electronic notices via email if the parent,\nguardian or unaccompanied youth has access to email followed by a written notice provided in person or sent by mail.\n67\n\nPreschool-Aged Homeless Children\nHomeless preschool-aged children and their families shall be provided equal access to the educational services for\nwhich they are eligible, including preschool programs, including Head Start programs, administered by the Academy.\nAdditionally, the homeless child must remain in the public preschool of origin, unless a determination is made that it\nis not in the child\u2019s best interest. When making such a decision on the student\u2019s best interest, the Academy takes into\naccount the same factors as it does for any student, regardless of age. It also considers pre- school age specific\nfactors, such as 1) the child\u2019s attachment to preschool teachers and staff; 2) the impact of school climate on the child,\nincluding school safety; the quality and availability of services to meet the child\u2019s needs, including health,\ndevelopmental, and social-emotional needs; and 3) travel time to and from school.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will also provide transportation services to the school of origin for a homeless\nchild attending preschool.

In addition, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will post public\nnotice of the McKinney-Vento rights in places that homeless populations frequent, such as shelters, soup kitchens,\nand libraries in a manner and form understandable to the parents and guardians and unaccompanied youths.\nHomeless Student Records\nThe local liaison will assist the homeless students and their parent(s) or guardian(s) or unaccompanied homeless\nstudents in their efforts to provide documentation to meet State and local requirements for entry into school.\nAll records for homeless students shall be maintained, subject to the protections of the Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act (FERPA), and in such a manner so that they are available in a timely fashion and can be transferred\npromptly to the appropriate parties, as required. Pursuant to the McKinney-Vento Act, information regarding a\nhomeless student\u2019s living situation is not considered directory information and must be provided the same\nprotections as other non-directory personally identifiable information (PII) contained in student education records\nunder FERPA.\nNo Board policy, administrative procedure, or practice will be interpreted or applied in such a way as to inhibit the\nenrollment, attendance, or school success of homeless children.\n\nMedication Policy\nUSE OF MEDICATIONS\n\nNeither the Board of Directors nor the school leader shall be responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of student\nillness. The administration of prescribed medication and/or medically prescribed treatments to a student during\nschool hours will be permitted only when failure to do so would jeopardize the health of the student, the student\nwould not be able to attend school if the medication or treatment were not made available during school hours, or\nthe child is disabled and requires medication to benefit from his/her educational program.\n68\n\nFor purposes of this policy, medication shall include all medicines including those prescribed by a physician and\nany non-prescribed (over the counter) drugs, preparations, and/or remedies and performance- enhancing drugs\nas defined in AG 2431C. Treatment refers both to the manner in which a medication is administered and to health\ncare procedures that require special training, such as catheterization.\nBefore any prescribed medication or treatment may be administered to any student during school hours, the Board\nshall require the written prescription from the child's physician and the written authorization of the parent.\nBefore any non-prescribed medication or treatment may be administered, the Board shall require the prior written\nconsent of the parent who must also authorize any self-medication by his/her child. Medications will be\nadministered by the Academy in accordance with the school leader's procedures.\nOnly medication in its original container that is labeled with the date (if a prescription), the student's name, and exact\ndosage may be administered. Parents, or students authorized in writing by their physician and parent(s) may\nadminister medication or treatment. Staff members are to administer medication or treatment only in the presence of\nanother adult, except in the case of an emergency that threatens the life or health of the student. Staff licensed as\nprofessional registered nurses are exempt from this requirement.\nAll staff authorized to administer medication or treatment will receive training on appropriate procedures for\nadministering the medication or treatment. This training shall be provided by qualified individuals with knowledge of\nthe Academy's policy and procedures and knowledge of the administration of medications or treatment.\nStudents may possess and self-administer a metered dose or dry powder inhaler for relief of asthma (or before\nexercise to prevent onset of asthma symptoms), while at the school, on school-sponsored transportation, or at any\nschool-sponsored activity in accordance with the Administrative Procedures, if all of the following conditions are\nmet:\n\u2022 There is written approval from the student's physician or other health care provider and the student's\nparent/guardian (if student is under eighteen (18) to possess and use the inhaler (Form 5330 F1c); and\n\u2022 The School Leader has received a copy of the written approvals from the physician and the parent/guardian;\nand\n\u2022 There is on file at the student's Academy a written emergency care plan prepared by a licensed physician in\ncollaboration with the student and his/her parent/legal guardian.

The School Leader\nshall prepare Administrative Procedures to ensure the proper implementation of this policy.\n\n69\n\nSpecial Education Services\nSpecial Education Manager\nNancy Tuckey\n855-337-8243 X 7004\nntuckey@highpointva.org\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\u2019s Special Education program meets the individual needs of students by\nusing specially-designed instruction with a standards-based curriculum in the virtual environment. Frequent\nassessment of student progress is necessary. We deliver mckin programming and related services to Highpoint\nVirtual Academy of Michigan students at no cost to the parent or guardian. Students with disabilities needing\nspecial education must receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE). These services conform to the student\u2019s\nIndividual Education Program (IEP).\n\nServices by Disability\nSpecial Education services are collaborative teamwork among the parent/guardian, teachers, and therapists to\nprovide a systematic problem-solving approach for a quality education to each student. All members of the\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan school community believe that varied instructional practices and learning\nenvironments benefit all children.\nServices by disability area are as follows:\n\u2022 Autism Spectrum Disorder Visual Impairment\n\u2022 Hearing Impairment\n\u2022 Cognitive Impairment\n\u2022 Severe Multiple Impairments\n\u2022 Traumatic Brain Injury\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nEmotional Impairment\nPhysical Impairment\nEarly Childhood Development Delays\nSpecific Learning Disability\nSpeech and Language Impairment\nDeaf-Blindness\nOther health impairments\n\nChild Find\nHVAM seeks to assure that all of its students with disabilities, including those who are homeless or are wards of the\nMichigan, and children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of the severity of their disability, and who\nare in need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated; and (ii) A practical\nmethod is developed and implemented to determine which children are currently receiving needed special education\nand related services.\nChild find questions are completed by the parent within the online enrollment portal. These questions are asked\nagain during the enrollment approval and placement process.\n\n70\n\nOnce the school year begins, the assigned general education teacher will again query the parent in order to determine\nif the student has any academic need. tudent for whom a parent answers that they previously or are currently\nreceiving special education services is immediately referred to the Special Education Manager or designee.\nAny special education or evaluation records shared by the parent with the assigned homeroom teacher are forwarded\nto the special education department at HVAM so that they can be reviewed by the school psychologist and/or Special\nEducation Manager or designee to determine next steps.\nFor more information regarding Special Education Child Find: https://tinyurl.com/y94ud65k\n\nIDEA\n\nThe 2007 Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandate that every school\ndistrict in the country develop a system to identify children (from birth through age 21), with disabilities, who\nlive in that specific district. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will make a concerted effort to identify, to\nlocate and to evaluate children through 21 years of age who enroll in Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\nand have a confirmed or suspected disability, in accordance with all federal regulations and state standards. In\naddition, it shall be the policy of Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan that children with disabilities, as well as\ntheir parents/guardians, shall be provided with safeguards as required by law, throughout the identification,\nevaluation, and placement process and to provide these children with a free, appropriate, public education.\n\nFor more information regarding IDEA: https://tinyurl.com/y94ud65k\nSpecial Education Screening\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan screens and evaluates children to determine eligibility for special\neducation and related services. We undertake screening activities before referring most children for a\nmultidisciplinary team evaluation. Screening activities consist of the following:\n\u2022 On-going analysis of the child\u2019s response to instruction and performance on statewide and\ndistrict-wide assessments\n\u2022 Periodic vision and hearing assessments by the school nurse and review of the results of physical\nexaminations by school or private physicians as mandated by the Michigan Public School Code\n\u2022 Baseline assessment and analysis of the child\u2019s response to individualized academic or behavioral\nintervention over an extended period. Such intervention-based screening occurs when requested by\nthe child\u2019s teacher, parents/guardian(s), or other concerned school personnel.\nFor information about the dates of various screening activities by Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan, please\ncontact the school directly. Parents or guardians of preschool-age children (three through five) may obtain\ninformation about screening activities, or may request a screening of their children by calling or writing their\nlocal school district\u2019s Early Intervention Services.\n\nMulti-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS)\n\nThe MTSS framework consists of three levels or tiers that are fluid and overlapping. The tiers provide various levels of\nsupport to students in terms of duration and intensiveness. The more instructional support needed the higher up on\nthe model the student moves. Teachers using MTSS utilize research-based instructional practices, targeted\ninterventions, and curricular enhancements to support students in accomplishing their individual learning goals and\ninclude innovative scheduling and resource allocations. Fluidity between the instructional tiers is critical to students\u2019\nreceiving the supports they need. Every student is given an opportunity to meet or exceed proficiency standards by\nteachers utilizing data in an effective and collaborative decision-making process, which results in differentiating\n71\n\ninstructional practices for all learners.\n\nCommitment to Serve Students\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan is committed to the full implementation of NCLB and IDEA. When students\nwith special education needs are given the support necessary for success as outlined by their IEP, we believe they\ncan achieve at the same high standards that are required for all students enrolled in our school. Therefore, we will\nensure that our enrolled students with special education needs will have full access to those curricular offerings\naligned to Michigan Grade Level Content Expectations (GLCE).\n\n504 Service Plan and Child Find\nNancy Tuckey\n855-337-8243 X 7004\nntuckey@highpointva.org\n\nUnder Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and under the Federal Americans with Disabilities\nAmendment Act, some school-age children with disabilities who do not meet the eligibility criteria may\nnevertheless be eligible for special protections and for adaptations and accommodations in instruction, facilities,\nand activities. Children are entitled to such protections, adaptations, and accommodations if they have a\ndocumented mental or physical disability that substantially limits or prohibits participation in, or access to, an\naspect of the school program.\n\nCHILD FIND: United States Department of Education Guidance\nThe process Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan uses to identify students eligible for services under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan uses the same process to evaluate the needs of students under\nSection 504 as they use to evaluate the needs of students under the IDEA. Highpoint Virtual Academy of\nMichigan may use the same process or if the student has a medical condition that is outlined below, a medical\nprocess may be used. Highpoint follows the requirements for evaluation specified in the Section 504\nregulatory provision at 34 C.F.R. 104.35.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan does not consider \"mitigating measures\" used by a student in determining\nwhether the student has a disability under Section 504?\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nBeginning January 1, 2009, school districts, in determining whether a student has a physical or mental\nimpairment that substantially limits that student in a major life activity, must not consider the ameliorating or\nimproving effects of any mitigating or reducing measures that a student is using. This is a change from prior\nlaw.\nCongress did not define the term \u201cmitigating measures\u201d but rather provided a non-exhaustive list of\n\u201cmitigating measures.\u201d The mitigating measures are as follows: medication; medical supplies, equipment or\nappliances; low-vision devices (which do not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses); prosthetics\n(including limbs and devices); hearing aids and cochlear implants or other implantable hearing devices;\nmobility devices; oxygen therapy equipment and supplies; use of assistive technology; reasonable\naccommodations or auxiliary aids or services; and learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.\n72\n\n\u2022\n\nCongress created one exception to the mitigating measures analysis. The ameliorative effects of the\nmitigating measures of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered in determining if an\nimpairment substantially limits a major life activity. \u201cOrdinary eyeglasses or contact lenses\u201d are lenses that\nare intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error, whereas \u201clow-vision devices\u201d (listed\nabove) are devices that magnify, enhance, or otherwise augment a visual image.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands it must use multiple formulas or scales that measures\nsubstantial limitation.\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\u2019s determination of substantial limitation must be made on a case-bycase basis with respect to each individual student. The Section 504 regulatory provision at 34 C.F.R. 104.35 (c)\nrequires that a group of knowledgeable persons draw upon information from a variety of sources in making\nthis determination.\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may and most often will utilize data obtained by a multi-tier system of\nsupports team, the classroom teacher data reports, a physician\u2019s statement, a prior evaluation data, or a\nprevious school\u2019s determination.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands there are no impairments which automatically means a\nstudent has a disability under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands an impairment in and of itself is not a disability. The\nimpairment must substantially limit one or more major life activities in order to be considered a disability\nunder Section 504.\n\nA medical diagnosis cannot suffice as an evaluation for the purpose of providing FAPE (Free and Appropriate Public\nEducation)\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan does accept a physician's medical diagnosis as one of several data\nsources, among other sources that are considered in evaluating a student with an impairment or believed to\nhave an impairment which substantially limits a major life activity. Other sources to be considered, along with\nthe medical diagnosis, include aptitude and achievement tests, multi-tier systems of support team\nrecommendation, teacher recommendation, physical condition, social and cultural background, and adaptive\nbehavior. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, require school districts to draw upon a variety of\nsources in interpreting evaluation data and making placement decisions.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands a medical diagnosis of an illness automatically mean a student\ncan receive services under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands a medical diagnosis of an illness does not automatically\nmean a student can receive services under Section 504. Further, the illness must cause a substantial limitation\non the student's ability to learn or another major life activity. For example, a student who has a physical or\nmental impairment would not be considered a student in need of services under Section 504 if the\nimpairment does not in any way limit the student's ability to learn or other major life activity, or only results\nin some minor limitation in that regard.\n73\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may utilize an outside independent evaluation. Highpoint Virtual Academy\nof Michigan considers all data brought to a multi-disciplinary committee where the weight of each is determined by\na committee.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may utilize a Multi-disciplinary committee such as the multi-tier\nsystem of supports team, the classroom teacher data reports, a physician\u2019s statement, a prior evaluation data,\nor a previous school\u2019s determination, and understands the results of an outside independent evaluation may\nbe one of many sources to consider. The Multi-disciplinary committees, such as must draw from a variety of\nsources in the evaluation process so that the possibility of error is minimized. All significant factors related to\nthe subject student's learning process must be considered. These sources and factors include aptitude and\nachievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social and cultural background, and\nadaptive behavior, among others. Information from all sources must be documented and considered by\nknowledgeable committee members. The weight of the information is determined by the committee given\nthe student's individual circumstances.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may use regular education intervention strategies for referring a student\nfor evaluation for services under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may use regular education intervention strategies to assist students\nwith difficulties in school. Highpoint understands Section 504 requires students referred for an evaluation for\npossible Section 504 or special education or related aids and services or modification to regular education if\nthe student, because of disability, needs or is believed to need such services.\n\nPlease note the following:\nIf a parent of a student does not wish services to continue, may they withdraw the services?\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may initiate a Section 504 due process hearing to resolve the dispute\nif the district believes the student needs the services in order to receive an appropriate education.\n\nA student who has a disability referenced in the IDEA, but does not require special education services, the student\nmay be eligible for services under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nThe student may be eligible for services under Section 504. Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan must\ndetermine whether the student has an impairment which substantially limits his or her ability to learn or\nanother major life activity and, if so, make an individualized determination of the child's educational needs for\nregular or special education or related aids or services. For example, such a student may receive adjustments\nin the regular classroom.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan view of a temporary impairment, such as a broken leg, arm or other\ntemporary circumstances.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands a temporary impairment does not constitute a disability\nfor purposes of Section 504 unless its severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or more\nmajor life activities for an extended period of time. The issue of whether a temporary impairment is\nsubstantial enough to be a disability must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both\n74\n\n\u2022\n\nthe duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to which it actually limits a major life\nactivity of the affected individual.\nCongress clarified that an individual is not \u201cregarded as\u201d an individual with a disability if the impairment is\ntransitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6\nmonths or less.\n\nAn impairment that is episodic or in remission may be a disability under Section 504.\n\u2022\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan understands under certain circumstances this may be true. Congress\nclarified that an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major\nlife activity when active. A student with such an impairment is entitled to a free appropriate public education\nunder Section 504.\n\nEnglish Language Learner Program\nELL Coordinator\n\nTim Jalkanen\n855-337-8243 X 7800\ntjalkanen@highpointva.org\nStudents who are identified as English Language Learners through a review of the Home Language Survey or other\nprocedure, will be given the WIDA screener within 10 days of enrollment. If the student has received previous ELL\nservices, the prior year\u2019s WIDA scores will be reviewed within 10 days of enrollment. WIDA scores will be reviewed\nand those students needing support will be provided targeted English as a Second Language support.\nAll students who are identified as an English Language Learner by the state of Michigan are required to take the\nstate WIDA assessment in February-March each year until the student has achieved proficiency in English and can\nbe exited from the program. Information is available for translation by request. If needed a translator can be used\nto ensure parent/school communication.\n\nCommunication (My Info and Email)\nStudents and parents are able to contact their teachers through email. Staff emails will be made available by\nteachers and within the OLS system. Correspondence will be sent to Learning Coaches and families through their\npersonal email addresses as provided during enrollment. Students will be contacted via their school-based email. It\nis expected that students and parent/guardian read their email at least once a day. Critical information is sent via\nemail.\n\nNotice for Directory Information:\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal law, requires that Highpoint Virtual Academy of\nMichigan, with certain exceptions, obtain your written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable\ninformation from your child\u2019s education records. However, Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan may disclose\nappropriately designated \u201cdirectory information\u201d without written consent, unless you have advised Highpoint\nVirtual Academy of Michigan to the contrary in accordance with Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\nprocedures.\nThe primary purpose of directory information is to allow the Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan to\ninclude information from your child\u2019s education records in certain school publications.\n\n75\n\nExamples include:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nA playbill, showing your student\u2019s role in a drama production;\nThe annual yearbook;\nHonor roll or other recognition lists;\nGraduation programs; and\nSports activity sheets, such as for wrestling, showing weight and height of team members.\n\nDirectory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if\nreleased, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent\u2019s prior written consent.

Clubs facilitate student socialization, community and in some cases,\nservice. Clubs are sponsored by Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan teachers who welcome parent/guardian\nparticipation, as well. Teachers will provide a more detailed list along with contact information, as the school\nyear progresses. More clubs may be added as interests arise. Suggestions are always welcomed. Any materials or\nsupplies (outside of the supplied curriculum) needed for the clubs are the responsibility of the family- neither\nK12 nor Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan will provide these materials or supplies.\nPlease Note: School-based clubs hosted during the school day or within school platforms must have a teacher\nsponsor; however, non-sponsored student-led events, meetings, or forums will not be restricted based on religious,\nracial, gender or other basis unless said meetings are determined to cause potential significant disruption to the\nschool day.\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan Gatherings\n\nHighpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan teachers arrange a variety of special gatherings for students and families\nthroughout the year. Attendance is not required; however, these special gatherings provide wonderful\nopportunities to meet teachers, make new friends, and to talk with fellow parents/guardians about school.\nParents/guardians are responsible for the cost of transportation and any other fees. The fees are often negotiated\nand reduced for our school. Students qualifying under the McKinney Vento Policy may be eligible for transportation\nsupport to face to face events including testing and outings.\nTime spent on a field trip counts as attendance in the related subject. For example, a trip to a science museum\ncan count as attendance time in science. All gatherings/notices are posted on the School Community Board and/or\nthe online calendar of events.\nAny student may attend any outing he or she wishes by submitting an RSVP, if required, to the teacher listed in\nthe outing information.

As a result, educators are continually adapting their means and methods of instruction, and the way they\napproach student learning, to incorporate the vast, diverse, and unique resources available through the Internet. The\nBoard of Directors provides Technology Resources to support the educational and professional needs of its students\nand staff. With respect to students, Academy Technology Resources afford them the opportunity to acquire the skills\nand knowledge to learn effectively and live productively in a digital world. The Board of Directors provides students\nwith access to the Internet for limited educational purposes only and utilizes online educational services/apps to\nenhance the instruction delivered to its students. The Academy\u2019s computer network and Internet system does not\nserve as a public access service or a public forum, and the Board imposes reasonable restrictions on its use consistent\nwith its limited educational purpose.\nThe Board regulates the use of HVAM Technology Resources by principles consistent with applicable local, State, and\nFederal laws, HVAM\u2019s educational mission, and articulated expectations of student conduct as delineated in the\nStudent Code of Conduct. This policy and its related administrative guidelines and the Student Code of Conduct\ngovern students\u2019 use of HVAM Technology Resources and students\u2019 personal communication devices when they are\nconnected to the HVAM computer network, Internet connection, and/or online educational services/apps, or when\nused while the student is on Board-owned property or a Board-sponsored activity.\nUsers are required to refrain from actions that are illegal (such as libel, slander, vandalism, harassment, theft,\nplagiarism, inappropriate access, and the like) or unkind (such as personal attacks, invasion of privacy, injurious\ncomment, and the like). Because its Technology Resources are not unlimited, the Board has also instituted restrictions\naimed at preserving these resources, such as placing limits on use of bandwidth, storage space, and printers.\nUsers have no right or expectation to privacy when using HVAM Technology Resources (including, but not limited to,\nprivacy in the content of their personal files, e-mails, and records of their online activity when using the Academy\u2019s\ncomputer network and/or Internet connection).\nFirst, the Board may not be able to technologically limit access through its Technology Resources, to only those\nservices and resources that have been authorized for the purpose of instruction, study and research related to the\ncurriculum. Unlike in the past when educators and community members had the opportunity to review and screen\nmaterials to assess their appropriateness for supporting and enriching the curriculum according to adopted\nprocedures and reasonable selection criteria (taking into account the varied instructional needs, learning styles,\nabilities, and developmental levels of the students who would be exposed to them), access to the Internet, because it\nserves as a gateway to any publicly available file server in the world, opens classrooms and students to electronic\ninformation resources that may not have been screened by educators for use by students of various ages.\nPursuant to Federal law, the Board has implemented technology protection measures that protect against (e.g., filter\nor block) access to visual displays/depictions/materials that are obscene, constitute child pornography, and/or are\nharmful to minors, as defined by the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act. At the discretion of the Board or the School\nLeader, the technology protection measures may be configured to protect against access to other material considered\ninappropriate for students to access. HVAM also utilizes software and/or hardware to monitor online activity of\nstudents to restrict access to child pornography and other material that is obscene, objectionable, inappropriate\n79\n\nand/or harmful to minors. However, the Board is cognizant of the fact that such software and/or hardware is not\nperfect and relies on students to self-police (and immediately cease viewing) online activity that would otherwise be\nin conflict with these policies and to immediately report such to the Head of School. The technology protection\nmeasures may not be disabled at any time that students may be using HVAM Technology Resources, if such disabling\nwill cease to protect against access to materials that are prohibited under the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act. Any\nstudent who attempts to disable the technology protection measures will be subject to discipline.\nThe Head of School may temporarily or permanently unblock access to websites or online educational services/apps\ncontaining appropriate material, if access to such sites has been inappropriately blocked by the technology protection\nmeasures. The determination of whether material is appropriate or inappropriate shall be based on the content of the\nmaterial and the intended use of the material, not on the protection actions of the technology protection measures.\nParents are advised that a determined user may be able to gain access to services and/or resources on the Internet\nthat the Board has not authorized for educational purposes. In fact, it is impossible to guarantee students will not gain\naccess through the Internet to information and communications that they and/or their parents may find\ninappropriate, offensive, objectionable or controversial. Parents of minors are responsible for setting and conveying\nthe standards that their children should follow when using the Internet.\nThe Head of School, is directed to prepare procedures which address students' safety and security while using e-mail,\nchat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications, and prohibit disclosure of personal identification\ninformation of minors and unauthorized access (e.g., \"hacking\"), cyber bullying and other unlawful or inappropriate\nactivities by minors online.\nPursuant to Federal law, students shall receive education about the following:\nC.\n\nsafety and security while using e-mail, chat rooms, social media, and other forms of direct electronic\ncommunications;\nD. the dangers inherent with the online disclosure of personally identifiable information;\nE.\nthe consequences of unauthorized access (e.g., \"hacking\", \u201charvesting\u201d, \u201cdigital piracy\u201d, \u201cdata mining\u201d, etc.),\ncyber bullying and other unlawful or inappropriate activities by students online, and\nF.\nunauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personally-identifiable information regarding minors.\nThe Board directs staff members to provide instruction for their students and/or the Educational Service Provider to\nimplement procedures regarding the appropriate use of technology and online safety and security as specified above.\nFurthermore, the Educational Service Provider will implement monitoring procedures for the online activities while\nstudents are at school.\nMonitoring may include, but is not necessarily limited to, visual observations of online activities during class sessions;\nor use of specific monitoring tools to review browser history and network, server, and computer logs.\nThe Educational Service Provider is responsible for providing training so that Internet users under their supervision\nare knowledgeable about this policy and its accompanying procedures. The Board expects that staff members will\nprovide guidance and instruction to students in the appropriate use of HVAM Technology Resources. Such training\nshall include, but not be limited to, education concerning appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other\nindividuals on social media, including in chat rooms, and cyber bullying awareness and response. All users of Academy\nTechnology Resources (and their parents if they are minors) are required to sign a written agreement to abide by the\nterms and conditions of this policy and its accompanying procedures.\nStudents are responsible for good behavior when using Academy Technology Resources \u2013 i.e., behavior comparable to\nthat expected of students when they are in classrooms, school hallways, and other school premises and school\n80\n\nsponsored events. Communications on the Internet are often public in nature. General school rules for behavior and\ncommunication apply. The Board does not approve any use of its Technology Resources that is not authorized by or\nconducted strictly in compliance with this policy and its accompanying procedures.\nStudents may only use HVAM Technology Resources to access or use social media if it is done for educational\npurposes in accordance with their teacher\u2019s approved plan for such use.\nUsers who disregard this policy and its accompanying procedures may have their use privileges suspended or revoked,\nand disciplinary action taken against them. Users are personally responsible and liable, both civilly and criminally, for\nuses of HVAM Technology Resources that are not authorized by this policy and its accompanying procedures.\nThe Board designates the Educational Service Provider and Head of School, as the persons responsible for initiating,\nimplementing, and enforcing this policy and its accompanying procedures as they apply to students\u2019 use of Academy\nTechnology Resources.\n\nAccountability\n\nPosting anonymous messages is not permitted unless authorized by the teacher of the online course. Impersonating\nanother person is also strictly prohibited. Use only your own user-name and password, but do not share these with\nanyone.\nDo not interfere with other users\u2019 ability to access Highpoint Virtual Academy of Michigan\u2019s Online School or\nVirtual High School or disclose anyone\u2019s password to others or allow them to use another user\u2019s account.

If your student will be absent for any reason, parents or guardians are required to notify the school via email at\nMVHSattendance@emailmtcs.org. Please refer to the MNVS Attendance Policy.\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\nAttendance Policy\nI. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this policy is to define student attendance and to provide structure for the procedures\nregarding student attendance, truancy, and enrollment. Because of the nature of being an online school, the\ndefinition of student attendance is not based on seat time in a physical location but rather on the student\nlogging in to their online platform, working in their classes and making significant progress in their course on a\ndaily basis. This policy also recognizes that student attendance and course completion are a joint responsibility\nto be shared by the students and their parents or guardians. In accordance with Minnesota state laws\nconcerning student attendance, the policy includes the school\u2019s truancy intervention processes.\n\n10\n\nII. GENERAL STATEMENT OF POLICY\nAttendance, defined in Section III as work completion, is required of all students enrolled in the charter school.\nIn accordance with MN state laws (noted at end of document) students who are not in attendance for 15\nconsecutive school days will be dropped from school enrollment. How attendance is tracked, how the school\nintervenes when absences are excessive, and to which other agencies the school must report depends upon the\nage of the particular student in question. See Section IV for these procedures.\nThe charter school recognizes that the responsibility for student attendance belongs to the students and their\nparents/guardians in a partnership for overall communication and learning. The different responsibilities are as\nfollows:\n1.) Students\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Students must demonstrate daily progress in each course for every school day on the school\ncalendar.\nb. Students communicate questions, computer problems, and school struggles with the student\nsupport specialist or school counselor.\nc. Students attend all required in-person testing days in required locations. Testing dates and\nlocations are determined by the school and will be made available to students and parents prior\nto the testing window.\n2.) Parents/Guardians\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Parents/guardians ensure that the student is making adequate daily progress.\nb. Parents/guardians provide the student with access to the necessary tools for student success.\nc. Parents/guardians inform the school in the event of an excusable student absence.\nd. Parents/guardians work cooperatively with the school and the student to solve any attendance\nproblems that may arise and take an active role in supporting the student in course completion.\n3.) The Charter School\u2019s Responsibilities\na. The charter school will monitor attendance, maintain accurate attendance records, and apply\nattendance policies uniformly.\nb. The charter school will provide reports to parents and students concerning progress and inform\nstudents and parents/guardians of any attendance issues.\nc. The charter school will work cooperatively with students and their parents/guardians to resolve\nany attendance problems that may arise.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nAbsence\u200b \u2013 The failure of a student to attend school virtually via one of the charter school\u2019s course delivery\nsystems and/or the failure to complete coursework. Whether an absence is excused or unexcused (as defined\nbelow), students are required to make up all work and continue toward successful completion of coursework in\norder to receive credit in accordance with the policy which governs the granting of credits. Students can avoid\nhaving absences (whether excused or unexcused) tracked by logging in daily and by making progress in their\nassigned coursework. When students anticipate future excused absences, they should work ahead in the weeks\nprior to the future excused absence in order to stay on track. When students encounter an unforeseen absence,\nthey will need to make up that work time within three school days of each absence, following an excused or\nunexcused absence.\n.\nAttendance\u200b \u2013 Attendance is not based on a student\u2019s physical attendance in any one location at any given time,\nwith the exception of required in-person testing. Attendance at MN Virtual High School is based on logging in\ndaily and making progress in their courses.\n\u25cf HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 9-12): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\n11\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST ONE assignment/quiz/test (something that is graded) for at least one\ncourse EACH SCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST TWO assignments/quizzes/tests (things that are graded) EACH\nSCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8) \u200bare required to virtually attend the weekly direct instruction\nwith their core area teachers. There will be specific days and times for each course.\nALL STUDENTS:\n\u25cf Meeting minimum attendance requirements, however, does not mean a student is making adequate\nprogress. Only submitting one assignment every day is not a sufficient amount of work to pass\ncourses by the end of the term.\n\u25cf STUDENTS SHOULD REGULARLY BE COMPLETING ABOUT 3-5\nASSIGNMENTS/QUIZZES/TESTS (ITEMS THAT ARE GRADED) IN THE SUM TOTAL OF\nTHEIR CLASSES EACH SCHOOL DAY. We highly recommend using the course schedules\nprovided and actively WORKING FOR 6 HOURS EVERY SCHOOL DAY to support adequate\nprogress.\n\u25cf All assignments are submitted through Moodle, the classroom platform.\n\u25cf Blank or incomplete assignments are not counted towards attendance.\n\u25cf Reading course material or touching base with a teacher or case manager is not sufficient for\nattendance.\n\u25cf The expectation is that if a student can only complete the minimum of one assignment on a given day,\nthey will be doing more work over the course of the rest of the week to maintain adequate progress.\n\u25cf Regarding students who experience anxiety: they must still meet minimum attendance requirements\nevery day. Teachers, support specialists, school counselors, and the school social worker are all\navailable during the regular school day to help a student. The first step is communication. Staff\nmembers can give guidance to calming strategies and help make a plan of action for that day.\n\nExcused absence\u200b \u2013 An acceptable absence as determined by the school. The burden of proof for a student\nbeing excused from school is placed on the parent/guardian of the student. Determination of the excused\nnature of the absence is left to principal discretion. \u200bPlease note:\u200b students may access and attend school virtually\nfrom their home 24 hours a day seven days a week. Excused absences should be few, far between, and due to\nextreme circumstances. The very nature of an online school allows students to maintain attendance while\ncircumstances would ordinarily prevent them from attending school. \u200bStudents who maintain their adequate\nwork completion percentages on a weekly basis will not be required to provide documentation except in the\ncase of a pre-approved absence (family vacation, etc.).\nThe following reasons are examples which are recognized by the school as legitimate:\na) Parent/doctor verified illness\u200b: an absence verified by a parent/guardian or doctor, in writing within\nthree days of the absence\u200b. The excuse must specify the health condition and why it prevents\nattendance at the online school. Should the illness prevent them from attending school virtually from\ntheir home, a doctor\u2019s note is required to verify the severity of the illness and the length of time\nanticipated that student would not be able to work online.\nb) Family emergencies\u200b: an absence resulting from a serious illness, injury or death of an immediate family\nmember.\nc) School directed activities\u200b: absences for field trips, athletic trips, music trips or other school activities\nplanned by the school.\nd) Prearranged family vacations\u200b: an exceptional circumstance which requires families to take a vacation\nduring the school year. A pre-approved absence must be submitted by email from the legal\nguardian/parent to the \u200bschool administration\u200b \u200b14 days in advance\u200b and be approved by the school prior\nthe absence in order for the absence to be excused. Work should be completed \u200bin advance\u200b of the\nabsence in preparation for the absence.\ne) Suspension\u200b: as defined by the charter school board of directors.\nf) Court appearances\u200b: an absence by a student who has been court ordered to appear and the absence has\n12\n\nbeen previously arranged by the parent/guardian with the school. Proof of court order and of actual\nappearance is required to verify this type of absence.\ng) Computer problems:\u200b an absence by a student whose computer access is not working. This problem\nmust be resolved within 24 hours. \u200bA maximum of 1 day can be excused for this reason; please\nrefer to the student contract signed at enrollment concerning alternate forms of computer\naccess for students.\nh) Exceptional circumstances\u200b: any other circumstances where permission may be granted at the discretion\nof the school principal, which is coordinated by the student with the principal, in advance or as the\noccasion arises. Example would be childbirth, hospitalization, detention center, etc.\nNote:\u200b In almost all cases, online work and adequate progress toward course completion is expected.\nUnexcused absence\u200b - An absence for reasons that are not recognized by the school authorities as legitimate.\nUnexcused absences are tracked for truancy and enrollment purposes. After any unexcused absence occurs,\nstudents are expected to return to successful completion of coursework in order to avoid truancy consequences\nand/or losing their enrollment in the charter school. \u200bThe following are examples of unacceptable reasons for\nabsence:\na)\nCar trouble\nb)\nOver slept; alarm did not work\nc)\nShopping\nd)\nRequired to perform duties at home (i.e. babysitting, cleaning, or caring for a relative) that\ninterfere with student\u2019s ability to complete schoolwork\ne)\nFamily vacation (not pre-approved); Visiting\nf)\nWork\ng)\nNo email or call from the parent/guardian verifying the absence\nh)\nComputer issues of more than one 24 hour period\ni)\nPersonal (no reason given)\nj)\nTruancy, as defined in this document\nk)\nOther absences as determined on a case by case basis\nl)\nMissing required state testing\nExtended absences\u200b \u2013 An absence of more than five consecutive school days. Students who accrue more than\nfive\u200b consecutive absences must provide documentation for the absences to be considered excused absences.\nStudents who are unable to provide this documentation are subject to attendance and truancy policies.\nStudents who accrue \u200bten\u200b consecutive absences will be warned that they are jeopardizing their enrollment in the\ncharter school\u200b. \u200bStudents who accrue \u200bfifteen\u200b consecutive unexcused absences will be dropped from the\nenrollment of the charter school, and, thereafter, would need to complete the enrollment application in order\nto be admitted back into school. No credit is earned in the time the student is not enrolled.\nA student absent for an extended period of time due to illness is eligible for a leave of absence. Parents should\ncontact the principal to make these arrangements. If a student has suffered an extended long term illness and\nrequired work has not been completed, the student may request an extension by completing the extension\nrequest form seven days prior to the end of the term. The principal has the authority to grant or to deny the\nextension based on individual student circumstance. The online school\u2019s curriculum is available 24 hours a\nday/seven days a week from any computer.\nTruancy\u200b \u2013 Truancy does not apply to students 18 years old or older. Students under the age of 18 are truant if\nthey do not generate attendance every day of school, which is defined by students logging into their courses\nand making progress daily.\n\n13\n\nIV. PROCEDURES\nA. In order to make the online system work alongside traditional school attendance policies, a conversion\nfrom continuous daily progress over to days absent must occur. Attendance calculations are made each\nday for all students. This is done by tracking students daily logged time into their coursees and\ndetermining the sum of successful work completion for all classes to determine the increase for each\nstudent.\n1. Students are expected to spend an average of approximately 60 minutes per day, per class in\norder to meet the school\u2019s expectation for attendance and avoid truancy.\n2. Students are also expected to make adequate progress in their classes daily to stay on pace to\ncomplete their courses by the end of the term.\nB. Enrollment at MN schools requires attendance. By law, students who accrue 15 consecutive unexcused\nabsences are dropped from the charter school enrollment. This policy applies \u200bto all students\nregardless of the age of the student. For students who are \u200b18 years of age and older\u200b, truancy does not\napply; however, attendance is still monitored in order to comply with the Minnesota Statute concerning\nenrollment in the charter school.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bfive days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter\nschool sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the\nabsences along with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will\nresult in loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n2. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\nsends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the absences\nalong with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in\ntheir loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200b15 days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\ndrops the students from enrollment and sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and\nparents/guardians of that fact.\nC. For students who are under \u200b18 years of age\u200b, enrollment laws as well as truancy laws apply. The charter\nschool must comply with the truancy procedures of each individual county in which students reside.\nFor truancy, absences are totaled; the absences do not need to be consecutive school days for truancy\nto be in effect. In addition, the school tracks consecutive absences in order to comply with the\nMinnesota statutes concerning enrollment.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bthree total days of unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends the\nstudent and parents/guardians with a warning letter concerning the absences, compulsory\neducation laws, and the fact that the student is considered a continuing truant.\n2. Depending on the policies and procedures of a student\u2019s county of residence, the student will\nbe referred to the county for early intervention when appropriate for the specific county.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200bseven cumulative days of unexcused absences\u200b, the student is\nconsidered a habitual truant. The school notifies the student and parents/guardians that the\nschool has filed a truancy offense report with the student\u2019s county of residence. The school\ncooperates with the county from this point forward, and a school official attends court should\nthe need arise.\n4. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends\nnotification via U.S. Mail to student/parent of student absences along with the warning that\ncontinued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in the student\u2019s loss of\nenrollment in the charter school. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county worker\nof the student\u2019s jeopardized enrollment.\n14\n\n5. When a student has accrued\u200b \u200bfifteen days \u200bof consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school is\nrequired by Minnesota statute to drop the student from enrollment and sends notification via\nU.S. Mail to student/parent of that fact. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county\nof the student\u2019s change in enrollment status.\nV. DISSEMINATION OF POLICY\nCopies of this policy are available to all students and parents. Should the policy be changed in the middle of a\nschool year, students and parents will be notified in a timely manner.\nStudent Conduct and Discipline\nStudent behavior should be based on the respect of others. Students who choose to violate the rules and policies set\nforth by MNVS will be subject to disciplinary action. The below list includes, but is not limited to, the areas of\nmisconduct to be considered grounds for disciplinary action:\n1.) Profanity\n2.) Truancy\n3.) Failure to complete course work\n4.) Defiance of authority\n5.) Violation of district and/or MNVS existing policies\nSuspension\nDisciplinary actions consist of suspension from the program and courses as determined by district and MNVS\nadministration. Any inappropriate behavior in the instant help chat feature may result in suspension from instant help\nchat. Students will still be allowed to access their course(s).\nState Mandated Testing\nAll students enrolled full\u200b-\u200btime in MNVS are \u200brequired\u200b to participate in the Minnesota Comprehension Assessment\nseries - state mandated graduation tests and annual achievement assessments; and the Career & College Readiness\nassessment series. Minnesota Testing facilities are located throughout Minnesota. Parents/students are responsible for\nthe transportation to and from testing facilities annually, and when necessary for students required to participate in\nassessment retakes for the GRAD components of the assessments. Failure to participate in these tests will result in a\ndelay of receiving a diploma, and unexcused absences.\nDetailed schedules for the MCA testing window will be updated as they are made available by the MDE. Please note\nthat specific locations and dates for all assessments are communicated via email to families. Parents and students are\nresponsible for identifying and attending the appropriate location for MCA and Career & College Readiness\nassessments from the schedule provided by MNVS.\nTESTING REQUIREMENTS\nMCA:\nGrade 7: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 8: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 10: Reading\nGrade 11: Mathematics\nGrade 11: ACT with Writing\n\n15\n\nGraduating students may also take college and career preparatory exams (i.e. ACT, Accuplacer, ASVAB) as approved\nby MTS MNVS to meet graduation requirements pursuant to Minnesota State Statute \u200b120B.30\u200b. Any questions\nregarding GRAD retakes or preparatory exams including eligibility and scheduling should be directed to the MNVS\nschool administration.\nFurther assessment information can be found on the \u200bMinnesota Department of Education website\u200b.\nSUPPLEMENTAL (PART-TIME) ONLINE LEARNING ENROLLMENTS\nStudents enrolled full-time in a local school district may elect to enroll in online courses courses equal to a maximum\nof 50% of their enrollments through an approved online learning provider. School districts and charter schools may\nnot prohibit a student from applying to enroll part-time in online learning. In order to apply, students under 18 must\nhave the written consent of his/her parent or guardian and submit a completed Online Learning Supplemental Notice\nof Student Registration form accompanied by the MNVS part-time enrollment packet.\nPart-time Enrollment Attendance\nSuccessful students in the supplemental online learning program at Minnesota Virtual High School spend a minimum\nof one hour each school day online working on each of their courses, making at minimum 1% progress in each course\neach school day. Although flexibility exists in the online program, students are expected to make adequate progress\neach week in order to ensure successful completion and full-credit earning. Failure to participate in this course weekly\nmay jeopardize your enrollment in this course.\nProgress Reporting\nThe Supplemental Program coordinator will submit progress reports to the local school contact person upon\ncompletion of the student\u2019s academic term. The student and family may access regular progress reports in the online\nlearning platform through the student gradebook anytime.\nFinal Grades and Submissions\nSemester and final grades are submitted to the school counselor within 10 days of the end of the term. Successfully\ncompleted MNVS courses carry 1.5 semester credits; credit conversions and graduation requirements do differ\nbetween school districts. Contact your school counselor for your local district\u2019s graduation requirements and credit\nconversion.\nACADEMIC GUIDELINES\nProgress Monitoring\nStudents and parents may check student progress by logging into the MNVS Classroom and viewing the student\ngradebook. The Grades link is on the home page for each course in which the student is enrolled. Questions about\nstudent progress should be directed to the teacher of a specific course.\nListed information includes: Student Name, Course Name, Course Grade. Assignment Grade, and Percentage\nComplete.\nCourse Grade: The course grade accounts for the quantity and quality of work that the student has completed thus\nfar in the course. \u200bThe Course Grade is the grade that determines the student\u2019s final grade at the end of the\ngrading period.\nAssignment Grade: The assignment grade is the quality of the assignments that have been submitted and graded.\nPercent Complete: The percent complete is the percentage of the assignments completed in the course thus far.\n\n16\n\nTo access detailed information for each course click on the \u201cGrades\u201d link; this will expand the screen to the user view\nand show all graded and upcoming assessments. Click on an individual assignment to view details and teacher\nfeedback.\n\nGrade Calculation Guide\nGrade Percentage (range)\n93-100%\n90-92.9%\n87-89.9%\n83-86.9%\n80-82.9%\n77-79.9%\n73-76.9%\n70-72.9%\n67-69.9%\n63-66.9%\n60-62.9%\n0-59.9%\n\nGrade\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nDF\n\nReset Procedure\nThe following is the recommended procedure for allowing assessment resets.\nHomework Assignments and Course Assessments\nHomework assignments, essays, unit quizzes, midterm exams, and final exams may be reset upon student discussion\nwith the course teacher when course assignments and previous course assessments (quizzes) are at a passing level. This\nincludes essay assignments and unit tests in accordance with the plagiarism policy (if applicable).\nAcademic Integrity\nMNVS expects a full commitment to academic integrity from each of our students. By enrolling in MNVS your\ncommitment to academic integrity as a student at MNVS will be recorded. Should your teacher suspect that cheating or\nplagiarism has taken place, you may be required to verify your work which can include additional demonstration of\nmastery such as additional course work, verbal demonstration of comprehension, and proctored exams in school at the\nMNVS offices.\na) Your work on each assignment will be completely your own.\nb) Your collaboration with another classmate on any assignment will be pre\u200b-\u200bapproved by your instructor.\nc) You will not practice cheating or plagiarism in any form.\nd) You will not allow others to copy your work.\ne) You will not misuse content from the Internet.\nPlagiarism\nWhat is it and why does it matter?\nPlagiarism is using other people\u2019s words, phrases, or ideas without giving them credit. Even if you put someone else\u2019s\nideas into your own words, you must still give them credit. Plagiarism can also take the form of copying the\norganization and/or sentence structure of another source. Plagiarism is intellectual theft and is unethical. Many colleges\nand universities expel students who have been found guilty of plagiarizing.\n\n17\n\nWhen do I need to document sources used in an assignment?\nHere are general guidelines that will help you determine if you need to document any sources used in an assignment. If\nyou have any questions about whether you should document a source, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment.\nYou need to document your sources in the following situations:\n\u25cf When you use or refer to someone else\u2019s words or ideas from a magazine, book, newspaper, song, TV\nprogram, movie, Web site, computer program, or any other format.\n\u25cf When you copy the exact words from a source.\n\u25cf When you paraphrase or summarize someone else\u2019s words or ideas.\n\u25cf When you copy or reprint any diagrams, charts, illustrations, or pictures.\nYou do NOT need to document sources in these situations:\n\u25cf When you write from your own experiences, observations, or insights.\n\u25cf When you write about your own conclusions about a subject or event.\n\u25cf When you are using \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that can be found in several sources. An example of common\nknowledge is: \u201cGeorge Washington was the first president of the United States.\u201d This is a fact that is found in\nseveral sources.\nHow do I document sources in my assignment?\nIf you have any questions about documenting sources in an assignment, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment. Also, here are links to information about MLA documentation style, which is the format that many MNVS\nteachers prefer:\nhttp://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/\nhttp://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/DocMLA.html\nhttp://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/newhelp/res_strategy/citing/mla.html\nConsequences for Plagiarizing at Minnesota Virtual High School\nIf a student plagiarizes an assignment in whole or in part, (s)he may retake the assignment for 50% credit. Notation of\nthe plagiarism will be documented in the student\u2019s MNVS permanent record. If the student should plagiarize another\nassignment in any subsequent class or subsequent term, (s)he may receive a zero for the assignment with no chance of\nretaking it. An additional offense may result in a failing grade for the course. The school district will be notified\nregarding each occurrence of plagiarism and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. \u200bWhen in doubt, ask your\nteacher!\nTECHNOLOGY AWARENESS\nAlong with global access comes availability of materials that may not be considered appropriate in the\nclassroom. However, on a global network it is impossible to control all the materials. Ultimately, \u200bstaff and\nstudents \u200bare responsible for compliance with the established standards when using media and informational\nresources.\nMTS MNVS Internet Use Policy\nStaff and Students \u200bare responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a\nclassroom. Communications on the network are often public in nature. General school rules for behavior and\ncommunications apply. Internet access is \u200brequired f\u200b or all MNVS students. MNVS assumes no responsibility for\nany phone charges, line costs or usage fees for connectivity to the Internet.\n\n18\n\nAccess is provided for \u200bstaff and students \u200bto communicate and conduct research with others in relation to\nschool activities in compliance with 1998, SB230, an Act relating to technology use, KAR 701.5:120 and the\nChildren\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) signed into law on December 21, 2000. Access to network services\nis given to staff and students who agree to act in a considerate and responsible manner. Access is a privilege,\nnot a right. Therefore, based upon the acceptable use guidelines outlined in this document, the directors will\ndeem what are appropriate: email uses, internet resources, and use of school/district resources. Their decisions\nare final. The director will instruct the systems engineer to deny, revoke, or suspend specific student user\naccounts, and reconfigure proxy-server and filtering settings. Further disciplinary actions will fall within the\ndiscretion of the directors.\nThe user is expected to abide by the following network and communication rules:\n\u25cf Do not use the network in such a way that would disrupt the use of the network by other users.\n\u25cf Do not exchange passwords or access other\u2019s network accounts. The user is responsible for the\nsecurity of his/her own password.\n\u25cf Do not attempt unauthorized access, including so-called \u201cHacking\u201d and other unlawful activities\nonto network or computer system configurations or bypass security programs to change settings or\naccess. Violations of this rule will be considered vandalism.\n\u25cf \u201cCyber Bullying\u201d will not be tolerated.\n\u25cf Do not use for commercial activities by for-profit organizations, product promotions, political\nlobbying, or illegal activities.\n\u25cf Do not use public property for personal gain (this is considered a felony and is subject to\nprosecution).\n\u25cf Do not violate copyright policies on software sharing or authorship of electronic information\n\u25cf Do not access, download, transmit, send or attach documents containing inappropriate matter on\nthe internet and World Wide Web harmful to minors (pornographic, obscene, or sexually explicit,\nthreatening, harassing materials).\n\u25cf Do not access, copy or transmit another\u2019s messages without permission.\n\u25cf The school is not responsible for loss or damage to a file due to unauthorized access or usage.\nViolation of any of the rules and responsibilities will result in a loss of access and may result in other\ndisciplinary or legal actions.\nSecurity Information\nAll the data you provide to us is protected to ensure both the privacy and security of your data. MNVS uses\nstate\u200b-\u200bof\u200b-\u200bthe art technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible to ensure that no one will be able to\ntamper with, intercept, or access your data. Remember to keep your account information private and secure.\nNetiquette\nNetiquette is etiquette, or appropriate behavior and manners on the internet. When using the Internet, there are widely\naccepted rules and behaviors to follow. At times being online can feel \u201cpretend\u201d because you cannot see the person\nyou are communicating with. It is important to make a positive impression, and to maintain that behavior as an online\nstudent.\nHow you interact and behave online is seen by both instructors and students. Students must remember they are dealing\nwith \u201creal\u201d people online and they should use the same manners they would use in a traditional school setting. It also\nimportant to note that once students log in to their school accounts, all communication via chat and email are\nrecorded.\n19\n\nBelow are some general netiquette guidelines to follow:\n\u25cf Remember the person on the other end of the computer.\nStudents are responsible for good behavior while logged into the MNVS online learning platform, just as they\nare in a traditional school building. Always use a computer in a way that shows consideration and respect. It is\nillegal to use obscene, profane, threatening, or disrespectful language.\nDo not threaten or disrespect an instructor or administrator. These actions not only violate the MNVS\u2019s policy,\nbut may violate penal laws in the United States. (f.s. 847.001 Obscene Literature; Profanity).\n\u25cf Think before you send or submit.\nIt is illegal to create harmful computer viruses. This violates the privacy of others. Never transmit or publish\nany information or content that you think will be harmful. This violates school policy and also violates penal\nlaws in the United States. (f.s. 815 Computer\u200b-\u200bRelated Crimes). Never publish any information, software, or\ncontent that violates the rights of others.\n\u25cf Be respectful.\nNever view files that were not intended for your use.\nPost discussion board threads that are a reflection of your understanding of the topic at hand in a respectful\nand intellectual manner.\nWrite in complete sentences with proper grammar. Remember that writing in all CAPS reflects a yelling tone\nand is both disrespectful and inappropriate in online communication. Instead, use \u200bitalics \u200bwhen you are making a\nparticularly important point.\n\u25cf The internet is not private.\nWhile MNVS works to ensure data privacy, email must not always be considered private. Never say anything\nvia email that you wouldn't mind seeing on the school bulletin board or in the local newspaper.\nThe information that you put on the internet, whether in school or outside of school (e.g. social networking),\nexists forever.\n\u25cf Many websites and pages are copyrighted.\nDo not violate the terms and conditions of any web site you access.\nAlways cite the works of others that you use in discussions, conversations, and the course work you submit.\n\u25cf Do not \u200bgive out personal information to non\u200b-\u200bMNVS staff. For example, you should not share the following\noutside of school: Your full name, home phone number, home address, email\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe Minnesota Virtual High School online Classroom provides a rich, interactive experience for students.

Please refer to the MNVS Attendance Policy.\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\nAttendance Policy\nI. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this policy is to define student attendance and to provide structure for the procedures\nregarding student attendance, truancy, and enrollment. Because of the nature of being an online school, the\ndefinition of student attendance is not based on seat time in a physical location but rather on the student\nlogging in to their online platform, working in their classes and making significant progress in their course on a\ndaily basis. This policy also recognizes that student attendance and course completion are a joint responsibility\nto be shared by the students and their parents or guardians. In accordance with Minnesota state laws\nconcerning student attendance, the policy includes the school\u2019s truancy intervention processes.\n\n10\n\nII. GENERAL STATEMENT OF POLICY\nAttendance, defined in Section III as work completion, is required of all students enrolled in the charter school.\nIn accordance with MN state laws (noted at end of document) students who are not in attendance for 15\nconsecutive school days will be dropped from school enrollment. How attendance is tracked, how the school\nintervenes when absences are excessive, and to which other agencies the school must report depends upon the\nage of the particular student in question. See Section IV for these procedures.\nThe charter school recognizes that the responsibility for student attendance belongs to the students and their\nparents/guardians in a partnership for overall communication and learning. The different responsibilities are as\nfollows:\n1.) Students\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Students must demonstrate daily progress in each course for every school day on the school\ncalendar.\nb. Students communicate questions, computer problems, and school struggles with the student\nsupport specialist or school counselor.\nc. Students attend all required in-person testing days in required locations. Testing dates and\nlocations are determined by the school and will be made available to students and parents prior\nto the testing window.\n2.) Parents/Guardians\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Parents/guardians ensure that the student is making adequate daily progress.\nb. Parents/guardians provide the student with access to the necessary tools for student success.\nc. Parents/guardians inform the school in the event of an excusable student absence.\nd. Parents/guardians work cooperatively with the school and the student to solve any attendance\nproblems that may arise and take an active role in supporting the student in course completion.\n3.) The Charter School\u2019s Responsibilities\na. The charter school will monitor attendance, maintain accurate attendance records, and apply\nattendance policies uniformly.\nb. The charter school will provide reports to parents and students concerning progress and inform\nstudents and parents/guardians of any attendance issues.\nc. The charter school will work cooperatively with students and their parents/guardians to resolve\nany attendance problems that may arise.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nAbsence\u200b \u2013 The failure of a student to attend school virtually via one of the charter school\u2019s course delivery\nsystems and/or the failure to complete coursework. Whether an absence is excused or unexcused (as defined\nbelow), students are required to make up all work and continue toward successful completion of coursework in\norder to receive credit in accordance with the policy which governs the granting of credits. Students can avoid\nhaving absences (whether excused or unexcused) tracked by logging in daily and by making progress in their\nassigned coursework. When students anticipate future excused absences, they should work ahead in the weeks\nprior to the future excused absence in order to stay on track. When students encounter an unforeseen absence,\nthey will need to make up that work time within three school days of each absence, following an excused or\nunexcused absence.\n.\nAttendance\u200b \u2013 Attendance is not based on a student\u2019s physical attendance in any one location at any given time,\nwith the exception of required in-person testing. Attendance at MN Virtual High School is based on logging in\ndaily and making progress in their courses.\n\u25cf HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 9-12): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\n11\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST ONE assignment/quiz/test (something that is graded) for at least one\ncourse EACH SCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST TWO assignments/quizzes/tests (things that are graded) EACH\nSCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8) \u200bare required to virtually attend the weekly direct instruction\nwith their core area teachers. There will be specific days and times for each course.\nALL STUDENTS:\n\u25cf Meeting minimum attendance requirements, however, does not mean a student is making adequate\nprogress. Only submitting one assignment every day is not a sufficient amount of work to pass\ncourses by the end of the term.\n\u25cf STUDENTS SHOULD REGULARLY BE COMPLETING ABOUT 3-5\nASSIGNMENTS/QUIZZES/TESTS (ITEMS THAT ARE GRADED) IN THE SUM TOTAL OF\nTHEIR CLASSES EACH SCHOOL DAY. We highly recommend using the course schedules\nprovided and actively WORKING FOR 6 HOURS EVERY SCHOOL DAY to support adequate\nprogress.\n\u25cf All assignments are submitted through Moodle, the classroom platform.\n\u25cf Blank or incomplete assignments are not counted towards attendance.\n\u25cf Reading course material or touching base with a teacher or case manager is not sufficient for\nattendance.\n\u25cf The expectation is that if a student can only complete the minimum of one assignment on a given day,\nthey will be doing more work over the course of the rest of the week to maintain adequate progress.\n\u25cf Regarding students who experience anxiety: they must still meet minimum attendance requirements\nevery day. Teachers, support specialists, school counselors, and the school social worker are all\navailable during the regular school day to help a student. The first step is communication. Staff\nmembers can give guidance to calming strategies and help make a plan of action for that day.\n\nExcused absence\u200b \u2013 An acceptable absence as determined by the school. The burden of proof for a student\nbeing excused from school is placed on the parent/guardian of the student. Determination of the excused\nnature of the absence is left to principal discretion. \u200bPlease note:\u200b students may access and attend school virtually\nfrom their home 24 hours a day seven days a week. Excused absences should be few, far between, and due to\nextreme circumstances. The very nature of an online school allows students to maintain attendance while\ncircumstances would ordinarily prevent them from attending school. \u200bStudents who maintain their adequate\nwork completion percentages on a weekly basis will not be required to provide documentation except in the\ncase of a pre-approved absence (family vacation, etc.).\nThe following reasons are examples which are recognized by the school as legitimate:\na) Parent/doctor verified illness\u200b: an absence verified by a parent/guardian or doctor, in writing within\nthree days of the absence\u200b. The excuse must specify the health condition and why it prevents\nattendance at the online school. Should the illness prevent them from attending school virtually from\ntheir home, a doctor\u2019s note is required to verify the severity of the illness and the length of time\nanticipated that student would not be able to work online.\nb) Family emergencies\u200b: an absence resulting from a serious illness, injury or death of an immediate family\nmember.\nc) School directed activities\u200b: absences for field trips, athletic trips, music trips or other school activities\nplanned by the school.\nd) Prearranged family vacations\u200b: an exceptional circumstance which requires families to take a vacation\nduring the school year. A pre-approved absence must be submitted by email from the legal\nguardian/parent to the \u200bschool administration\u200b \u200b14 days in advance\u200b and be approved by the school prior\nthe absence in order for the absence to be excused. Work should be completed \u200bin advance\u200b of the\nabsence in preparation for the absence.\ne) Suspension\u200b: as defined by the charter school board of directors.\nf) Court appearances\u200b: an absence by a student who has been court ordered to appear and the absence has\n12\n\nbeen previously arranged by the parent/guardian with the school. Proof of court order and of actual\nappearance is required to verify this type of absence.\ng) Computer problems:\u200b an absence by a student whose computer access is not working. This problem\nmust be resolved within 24 hours. \u200bA maximum of 1 day can be excused for this reason; please\nrefer to the student contract signed at enrollment concerning alternate forms of computer\naccess for students.\nh) Exceptional circumstances\u200b: any other circumstances where permission may be granted at the discretion\nof the school principal, which is coordinated by the student with the principal, in advance or as the\noccasion arises. Example would be childbirth, hospitalization, detention center, etc.\nNote:\u200b In almost all cases, online work and adequate progress toward course completion is expected.\nUnexcused absence\u200b - An absence for reasons that are not recognized by the school authorities as legitimate.\nUnexcused absences are tracked for truancy and enrollment purposes. After any unexcused absence occurs,\nstudents are expected to return to successful completion of coursework in order to avoid truancy consequences\nand/or losing their enrollment in the charter school. \u200bThe following are examples of unacceptable reasons for\nabsence:\na)\nCar trouble\nb)\nOver slept; alarm did not work\nc)\nShopping\nd)\nRequired to perform duties at home (i.e. babysitting, cleaning, or caring for a relative) that\ninterfere with student\u2019s ability to complete schoolwork\ne)\nFamily vacation (not pre-approved); Visiting\nf)\nWork\ng)\nNo email or call from the parent/guardian verifying the absence\nh)\nComputer issues of more than one 24 hour period\ni)\nPersonal (no reason given)\nj)\nTruancy, as defined in this document\nk)\nOther absences as determined on a case by case basis\nl)\nMissing required state testing\nExtended absences\u200b \u2013 An absence of more than five consecutive school days. Students who accrue more than\nfive\u200b consecutive absences must provide documentation for the absences to be considered excused absences.\nStudents who are unable to provide this documentation are subject to attendance and truancy policies.\nStudents who accrue \u200bten\u200b consecutive absences will be warned that they are jeopardizing their enrollment in the\ncharter school\u200b. \u200bStudents who accrue \u200bfifteen\u200b consecutive unexcused absences will be dropped from the\nenrollment of the charter school, and, thereafter, would need to complete the enrollment application in order\nto be admitted back into school. No credit is earned in the time the student is not enrolled.\nA student absent for an extended period of time due to illness is eligible for a leave of absence. Parents should\ncontact the principal to make these arrangements. If a student has suffered an extended long term illness and\nrequired work has not been completed, the student may request an extension by completing the extension\nrequest form seven days prior to the end of the term. The principal has the authority to grant or to deny the\nextension based on individual student circumstance. The online school\u2019s curriculum is available 24 hours a\nday/seven days a week from any computer.\nTruancy\u200b \u2013 Truancy does not apply to students 18 years old or older. Students under the age of 18 are truant if\nthey do not generate attendance every day of school, which is defined by students logging into their courses\nand making progress daily.\n\n13\n\nIV. PROCEDURES\nA. In order to make the online system work alongside traditional school attendance policies, a conversion\nfrom continuous daily progress over to days absent must occur. Attendance calculations are made each\nday for all students. This is done by tracking students daily logged time into their coursees and\ndetermining the sum of successful work completion for all classes to determine the increase for each\nstudent.\n1. Students are expected to spend an average of approximately 60 minutes per day, per class in\norder to meet the school\u2019s expectation for attendance and avoid truancy.\n2. Students are also expected to make adequate progress in their classes daily to stay on pace to\ncomplete their courses by the end of the term.\nB. Enrollment at MN schools requires attendance. By law, students who accrue 15 consecutive unexcused\nabsences are dropped from the charter school enrollment. This policy applies \u200bto all students\nregardless of the age of the student. For students who are \u200b18 years of age and older\u200b, truancy does not\napply; however, attendance is still monitored in order to comply with the Minnesota Statute concerning\nenrollment in the charter school.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bfive days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter\nschool sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the\nabsences along with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will\nresult in loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n2. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\nsends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the absences\nalong with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in\ntheir loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200b15 days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\ndrops the students from enrollment and sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and\nparents/guardians of that fact.\nC. For students who are under \u200b18 years of age\u200b, enrollment laws as well as truancy laws apply. The charter\nschool must comply with the truancy procedures of each individual county in which students reside.\nFor truancy, absences are totaled; the absences do not need to be consecutive school days for truancy\nto be in effect. In addition, the school tracks consecutive absences in order to comply with the\nMinnesota statutes concerning enrollment.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bthree total days of unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends the\nstudent and parents/guardians with a warning letter concerning the absences, compulsory\neducation laws, and the fact that the student is considered a continuing truant.\n2. Depending on the policies and procedures of a student\u2019s county of residence, the student will\nbe referred to the county for early intervention when appropriate for the specific county.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200bseven cumulative days of unexcused absences\u200b, the student is\nconsidered a habitual truant. The school notifies the student and parents/guardians that the\nschool has filed a truancy offense report with the student\u2019s county of residence. The school\ncooperates with the county from this point forward, and a school official attends court should\nthe need arise.\n4. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends\nnotification via U.S. Mail to student/parent of student absences along with the warning that\ncontinued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in the student\u2019s loss of\nenrollment in the charter school. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county worker\nof the student\u2019s jeopardized enrollment.\n14\n\n5. When a student has accrued\u200b \u200bfifteen days \u200bof consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school is\nrequired by Minnesota statute to drop the student from enrollment and sends notification via\nU.S. Mail to student/parent of that fact. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county\nof the student\u2019s change in enrollment status.\nV. DISSEMINATION OF POLICY\nCopies of this policy are available to all students and parents. Should the policy be changed in the middle of a\nschool year, students and parents will be notified in a timely manner.\nStudent Conduct and Discipline\nStudent behavior should be based on the respect of others. Students who choose to violate the rules and policies set\nforth by MNVS will be subject to disciplinary action. The below list includes, but is not limited to, the areas of\nmisconduct to be considered grounds for disciplinary action:\n1.) Profanity\n2.) Truancy\n3.) Failure to complete course work\n4.) Defiance of authority\n5.) Violation of district and/or MNVS existing policies\nSuspension\nDisciplinary actions consist of suspension from the program and courses as determined by district and MNVS\nadministration. Any inappropriate behavior in the instant help chat feature may result in suspension from instant help\nchat. Students will still be allowed to access their course(s).\nState Mandated Testing\nAll students enrolled full\u200b-\u200btime in MNVS are \u200brequired\u200b to participate in the Minnesota Comprehension Assessment\nseries - state mandated graduation tests and annual achievement assessments; and the Career & College Readiness\nassessment series. Minnesota Testing facilities are located throughout Minnesota. Parents/students are responsible for\nthe transportation to and from testing facilities annually, and when necessary for students required to participate in\nassessment retakes for the GRAD components of the assessments. Failure to participate in these tests will result in a\ndelay of receiving a diploma, and unexcused absences.\nDetailed schedules for the MCA testing window will be updated as they are made available by the MDE. Please note\nthat specific locations and dates for all assessments are communicated via email to families. Parents and students are\nresponsible for identifying and attending the appropriate location for MCA and Career & College Readiness\nassessments from the schedule provided by MNVS.\nTESTING REQUIREMENTS\nMCA:\nGrade 7: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 8: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 10: Reading\nGrade 11: Mathematics\nGrade 11: ACT with Writing\n\n15\n\nGraduating students may also take college and career preparatory exams (i.e. ACT, Accuplacer, ASVAB) as approved\nby MTS MNVS to meet graduation requirements pursuant to Minnesota State Statute \u200b120B.30\u200b. Any questions\nregarding GRAD retakes or preparatory exams including eligibility and scheduling should be directed to the MNVS\nschool administration.\nFurther assessment information can be found on the \u200bMinnesota Department of Education website\u200b.\nSUPPLEMENTAL (PART-TIME) ONLINE LEARNING ENROLLMENTS\nStudents enrolled full-time in a local school district may elect to enroll in online courses courses equal to a maximum\nof 50% of their enrollments through an approved online learning provider. School districts and charter schools may\nnot prohibit a student from applying to enroll part-time in online learning. In order to apply, students under 18 must\nhave the written consent of his/her parent or guardian and submit a completed Online Learning Supplemental Notice\nof Student Registration form accompanied by the MNVS part-time enrollment packet.\nPart-time Enrollment Attendance\nSuccessful students in the supplemental online learning program at Minnesota Virtual High School spend a minimum\nof one hour each school day online working on each of their courses, making at minimum 1% progress in each course\neach school day. Although flexibility exists in the online program, students are expected to make adequate progress\neach week in order to ensure successful completion and full-credit earning. Failure to participate in this course weekly\nmay jeopardize your enrollment in this course.\nProgress Reporting\nThe Supplemental Program coordinator will submit progress reports to the local school contact person upon\ncompletion of the student\u2019s academic term. The student and family may access regular progress reports in the online\nlearning platform through the student gradebook anytime.\nFinal Grades and Submissions\nSemester and final grades are submitted to the school counselor within 10 days of the end of the term. Successfully\ncompleted MNVS courses carry 1.5 semester credits; credit conversions and graduation requirements do differ\nbetween school districts. Contact your school counselor for your local district\u2019s graduation requirements and credit\nconversion.\nACADEMIC GUIDELINES\nProgress Monitoring\nStudents and parents may check student progress by logging into the MNVS Classroom and viewing the student\ngradebook. The Grades link is on the home page for each course in which the student is enrolled. Questions about\nstudent progress should be directed to the teacher of a specific course.\nListed information includes: Student Name, Course Name, Course Grade. Assignment Grade, and Percentage\nComplete.\nCourse Grade: The course grade accounts for the quantity and quality of work that the student has completed thus\nfar in the course. \u200bThe Course Grade is the grade that determines the student\u2019s final grade at the end of the\ngrading period.\nAssignment Grade: The assignment grade is the quality of the assignments that have been submitted and graded.\nPercent Complete: The percent complete is the percentage of the assignments completed in the course thus far.\n\n16\n\nTo access detailed information for each course click on the \u201cGrades\u201d link; this will expand the screen to the user view\nand show all graded and upcoming assessments. Click on an individual assignment to view details and teacher\nfeedback.\n\nGrade Calculation Guide\nGrade Percentage (range)\n93-100%\n90-92.9%\n87-89.9%\n83-86.9%\n80-82.9%\n77-79.9%\n73-76.9%\n70-72.9%\n67-69.9%\n63-66.9%\n60-62.9%\n0-59.9%\n\nGrade\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nDF\n\nReset Procedure\nThe following is the recommended procedure for allowing assessment resets.\nHomework Assignments and Course Assessments\nHomework assignments, essays, unit quizzes, midterm exams, and final exams may be reset upon student discussion\nwith the course teacher when course assignments and previous course assessments (quizzes) are at a passing level. This\nincludes essay assignments and unit tests in accordance with the plagiarism policy (if applicable).\nAcademic Integrity\nMNVS expects a full commitment to academic integrity from each of our students. By enrolling in MNVS your\ncommitment to academic integrity as a student at MNVS will be recorded. Should your teacher suspect that cheating or\nplagiarism has taken place, you may be required to verify your work which can include additional demonstration of\nmastery such as additional course work, verbal demonstration of comprehension, and proctored exams in school at the\nMNVS offices.\na) Your work on each assignment will be completely your own.\nb) Your collaboration with another classmate on any assignment will be pre\u200b-\u200bapproved by your instructor.\nc) You will not practice cheating or plagiarism in any form.\nd) You will not allow others to copy your work.\ne) You will not misuse content from the Internet.\nPlagiarism\nWhat is it and why does it matter?\nPlagiarism is using other people\u2019s words, phrases, or ideas without giving them credit. Even if you put someone else\u2019s\nideas into your own words, you must still give them credit. Plagiarism can also take the form of copying the\norganization and/or sentence structure of another source. Plagiarism is intellectual theft and is unethical. Many colleges\nand universities expel students who have been found guilty of plagiarizing.\n\n17\n\nWhen do I need to document sources used in an assignment?\nHere are general guidelines that will help you determine if you need to document any sources used in an assignment. If\nyou have any questions about whether you should document a source, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment.\nYou need to document your sources in the following situations:\n\u25cf When you use or refer to someone else\u2019s words or ideas from a magazine, book, newspaper, song, TV\nprogram, movie, Web site, computer program, or any other format.\n\u25cf When you copy the exact words from a source.\n\u25cf When you paraphrase or summarize someone else\u2019s words or ideas.\n\u25cf When you copy or reprint any diagrams, charts, illustrations, or pictures.\nYou do NOT need to document sources in these situations:\n\u25cf When you write from your own experiences, observations, or insights.\n\u25cf When you write about your own conclusions about a subject or event.\n\u25cf When you are using \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that can be found in several sources. An example of common\nknowledge is: \u201cGeorge Washington was the first president of the United States.\u201d This is a fact that is found in\nseveral sources.\nHow do I document sources in my assignment?\nIf you have any questions about documenting sources in an assignment, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment. Also, here are links to information about MLA documentation style, which is the format that many MNVS\nteachers prefer:\nhttp://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/\nhttp://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/DocMLA.html\nhttp://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/newhelp/res_strategy/citing/mla.html\nConsequences for Plagiarizing at Minnesota Virtual High School\nIf a student plagiarizes an assignment in whole or in part, (s)he may retake the assignment for 50% credit. Notation of\nthe plagiarism will be documented in the student\u2019s MNVS permanent record. If the student should plagiarize another\nassignment in any subsequent class or subsequent term, (s)he may receive a zero for the assignment with no chance of\nretaking it. An additional offense may result in a failing grade for the course. The school district will be notified\nregarding each occurrence of plagiarism and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. \u200bWhen in doubt, ask your\nteacher!\nTECHNOLOGY AWARENESS\nAlong with global access comes availability of materials that may not be considered appropriate in the\nclassroom. However, on a global network it is impossible to control all the materials. Ultimately, \u200bstaff and\nstudents \u200bare responsible for compliance with the established standards when using media and informational\nresources.\nMTS MNVS Internet Use Policy\nStaff and Students \u200bare responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a\nclassroom. Communications on the network are often public in nature. General school rules for behavior and\ncommunications apply. Internet access is \u200brequired f\u200b or all MNVS students. MNVS assumes no responsibility for\nany phone charges, line costs or usage fees for connectivity to the Internet.\n\n18\n\nAccess is provided for \u200bstaff and students \u200bto communicate and conduct research with others in relation to\nschool activities in compliance with 1998, SB230, an Act relating to technology use, KAR 701.5:120 and the\nChildren\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) signed into law on December 21, 2000. Access to network services\nis given to staff and students who agree to act in a considerate and responsible manner. Access is a privilege,\nnot a right. Therefore, based upon the acceptable use guidelines outlined in this document, the directors will\ndeem what are appropriate: email uses, internet resources, and use of school/district resources. Their decisions\nare final. The director will instruct the systems engineer to deny, revoke, or suspend specific student user\naccounts, and reconfigure proxy-server and filtering settings. Further disciplinary actions will fall within the\ndiscretion of the directors.\nThe user is expected to abide by the following network and communication rules:\n\u25cf Do not use the network in such a way that would disrupt the use of the network by other users.\n\u25cf Do not exchange passwords or access other\u2019s network accounts. The user is responsible for the\nsecurity of his/her own password.\n\u25cf Do not attempt unauthorized access, including so-called \u201cHacking\u201d and other unlawful activities\nonto network or computer system configurations or bypass security programs to change settings or\naccess. Violations of this rule will be considered vandalism.\n\u25cf \u201cCyber Bullying\u201d will not be tolerated.\n\u25cf Do not use for commercial activities by for-profit organizations, product promotions, political\nlobbying, or illegal activities.\n\u25cf Do not use public property for personal gain (this is considered a felony and is subject to\nprosecution).\n\u25cf Do not violate copyright policies on software sharing or authorship of electronic information\n\u25cf Do not access, download, transmit, send or attach documents containing inappropriate matter on\nthe internet and World Wide Web harmful to minors (pornographic, obscene, or sexually explicit,\nthreatening, harassing materials).\n\u25cf Do not access, copy or transmit another\u2019s messages without permission.\n\u25cf The school is not responsible for loss or damage to a file due to unauthorized access or usage.\nViolation of any of the rules and responsibilities will result in a loss of access and may result in other\ndisciplinary or legal actions.\nSecurity Information\nAll the data you provide to us is protected to ensure both the privacy and security of your data. MNVS uses\nstate\u200b-\u200bof\u200b-\u200bthe art technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible to ensure that no one will be able to\ntamper with, intercept, or access your data. Remember to keep your account information private and secure.\nNetiquette\nNetiquette is etiquette, or appropriate behavior and manners on the internet. When using the Internet, there are widely\naccepted rules and behaviors to follow. At times being online can feel \u201cpretend\u201d because you cannot see the person\nyou are communicating with. It is important to make a positive impression, and to maintain that behavior as an online\nstudent.\nHow you interact and behave online is seen by both instructors and students. Students must remember they are dealing\nwith \u201creal\u201d people online and they should use the same manners they would use in a traditional school setting. It also\nimportant to note that once students log in to their school accounts, all communication via chat and email are\nrecorded.\n19\n\nBelow are some general netiquette guidelines to follow:\n\u25cf Remember the person on the other end of the computer.\nStudents are responsible for good behavior while logged into the MNVS online learning platform, just as they\nare in a traditional school building. Always use a computer in a way that shows consideration and respect. It is\nillegal to use obscene, profane, threatening, or disrespectful language.\nDo not threaten or disrespect an instructor or administrator. These actions not only violate the MNVS\u2019s policy,\nbut may violate penal laws in the United States. (f.s. 847.001 Obscene Literature; Profanity).\n\u25cf Think before you send or submit.\nIt is illegal to create harmful computer viruses. This violates the privacy of others. Never transmit or publish\nany information or content that you think will be harmful. This violates school policy and also violates penal\nlaws in the United States. (f.s. 815 Computer\u200b-\u200bRelated Crimes). Never publish any information, software, or\ncontent that violates the rights of others.\n\u25cf Be respectful.\nNever view files that were not intended for your use.\nPost discussion board threads that are a reflection of your understanding of the topic at hand in a respectful\nand intellectual manner.\nWrite in complete sentences with proper grammar. Remember that writing in all CAPS reflects a yelling tone\nand is both disrespectful and inappropriate in online communication. Instead, use \u200bitalics \u200bwhen you are making a\nparticularly important point.\n\u25cf The internet is not private.\nWhile MNVS works to ensure data privacy, email must not always be considered private. Never say anything\nvia email that you wouldn't mind seeing on the school bulletin board or in the local newspaper.\nThe information that you put on the internet, whether in school or outside of school (e.g. social networking),\nexists forever.\n\u25cf Many websites and pages are copyrighted.\nDo not violate the terms and conditions of any web site you access.\nAlways cite the works of others that you use in discussions, conversations, and the course work you submit.\n\u25cf Do not \u200bgive out personal information to non\u200b-\u200bMNVS staff. For example, you should not share the following\noutside of school: Your full name, home phone number, home address, email\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe Minnesota Virtual High School online Classroom provides a rich, interactive experience for students.

Students who fail a\ncourse are responsible for working with their school counselor to be re-enrolled in the course. Students and families\nare responsible for ensuring that all graduation requirements have been met through successful course completion.\nBoth grades will stay on the transcript unless the student was given an \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) for the previous course. An \u201cI\u201d\ncan be awarded to a student if the student was not able to complete the course due to a medical or family emergency,\nwhen the student retakes the course then the \u201cI\u201d will be replaced with a passing grade.\nCourse(s) Changes\nIn order to change a course students must submit a written request to the school counselor within three weeks \u200bof\nenrollment in the course. A course change is not official until it has been expressly approved by the school counselor.\nThis written request must include the following:\n\u25cf Student Name\n\u25cf Reason for request\n\u25cf The course(s) the student wishes to drop\nOnce the school counselor has approved the Change of the course(s), parents and students will receive written\nconfirmation of that change. Students must continue to work in all courses until the change has been confirmed.\nStudents wishing to withdraw from ALL of their classes must following the procedures set forth in the withdrawal\npolicy.\nCourse Extensions\nCourse extension requests must be completed and received by the school 7 calendar days prior to the end of an\nacademic term.\nTransfer Credits\nOfficial transcripts are required in order to properly transfer credits to the student.

Any requests for transcript revisions must be submitted to the MNVS registrars and will then be reviewed\nby the Director and/or Assistant Director for approval. Once approved changes will be reflected in the Student\nInformation platform and a new transcript will be processed.\nGraduation Requirements\nUpon completion of the enrollment process and each school year, students receive an electronic record of credits\nearned and current courses. Students may also request this record by contacting school counseling staff through email.\nThis record includes the courses the student has completed and credit earned towards graduation. It is possible that the\ncredit totals may be different than the previous schools attended, as Minnesota Transitions Charter Schools is based on\n1.5 \u200bcredits per semester class,\u200b with a total of 64.5 needed for graduation. Students do not lose credits when transferring\nschools, although credit conversions and graduation requirements do differ between school districts. Students may\nrequest a current credit count by contacting their school counselor.\nTo receive a diploma from Minnesota Virtual High School, each student is required to receive the following credits per\ncategory for a total of 64.5 credits in addition to meeting Minnesota state graduation requirements:\n\u25cf English \u2013 12 credits\n\u25cf Social Studies \u2013 12 credits\n6\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\nMath \u2013 9 credits\nScience \u2013 9 credits\nFine Arts \u2013 3 credits\nPE/Health \u2013 3 credits\nElectives \u2013 16.5 credits\n\nAdvanced Placement\nWe do not offer Advanced Placement courses at this time.\nPost-Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO)\nPSEO is a Minnesota state funded program that provides qualifying high school students with the opportunity to earn\npost-secondary education credits while still completing high school.

If your student will be absent for any reason, parents or guardians are required to notify the school via email at\nMVHSattendance@emailmtcs.org. Please refer to the MNVS Attendance Policy.\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\nAttendance Policy\nI. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this policy is to define student attendance and to provide structure for the procedures\nregarding student attendance, truancy, and enrollment. Because of the nature of being an online school, the\ndefinition of student attendance is not based on seat time in a physical location but rather on the student\nlogging in to their online platform, working in their classes and making significant progress in their course on a\ndaily basis. This policy also recognizes that student attendance and course completion are a joint responsibility\nto be shared by the students and their parents or guardians. In accordance with Minnesota state laws\nconcerning student attendance, the policy includes the school\u2019s truancy intervention processes.\n\n10\n\nII. GENERAL STATEMENT OF POLICY\nAttendance, defined in Section III as work completion, is required of all students enrolled in the charter school.\nIn accordance with MN state laws (noted at end of document) students who are not in attendance for 15\nconsecutive school days will be dropped from school enrollment. How attendance is tracked, how the school\nintervenes when absences are excessive, and to which other agencies the school must report depends upon the\nage of the particular student in question. See Section IV for these procedures.\nThe charter school recognizes that the responsibility for student attendance belongs to the students and their\nparents/guardians in a partnership for overall communication and learning. The different responsibilities are as\nfollows:\n1.) Students\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Students must demonstrate daily progress in each course for every school day on the school\ncalendar.\nb. Students communicate questions, computer problems, and school struggles with the student\nsupport specialist or school counselor.\nc. Students attend all required in-person testing days in required locations. Testing dates and\nlocations are determined by the school and will be made available to students and parents prior\nto the testing window.\n2.) Parents/Guardians\u2019 Responsibilities\na. Parents/guardians ensure that the student is making adequate daily progress.\nb. Parents/guardians provide the student with access to the necessary tools for student success.\nc. Parents/guardians inform the school in the event of an excusable student absence.\nd. Parents/guardians work cooperatively with the school and the student to solve any attendance\nproblems that may arise and take an active role in supporting the student in course completion.\n3.) The Charter School\u2019s Responsibilities\na. The charter school will monitor attendance, maintain accurate attendance records, and apply\nattendance policies uniformly.\nb. The charter school will provide reports to parents and students concerning progress and inform\nstudents and parents/guardians of any attendance issues.\nc. The charter school will work cooperatively with students and their parents/guardians to resolve\nany attendance problems that may arise.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nAbsence\u200b \u2013 The failure of a student to attend school virtually via one of the charter school\u2019s course delivery\nsystems and/or the failure to complete coursework. Whether an absence is excused or unexcused (as defined\nbelow), students are required to make up all work and continue toward successful completion of coursework in\norder to receive credit in accordance with the policy which governs the granting of credits. Students can avoid\nhaving absences (whether excused or unexcused) tracked by logging in daily and by making progress in their\nassigned coursework. When students anticipate future excused absences, they should work ahead in the weeks\nprior to the future excused absence in order to stay on track. When students encounter an unforeseen absence,\nthey will need to make up that work time within three school days of each absence, following an excused or\nunexcused absence.\n.\nAttendance\u200b \u2013 Attendance is not based on a student\u2019s physical attendance in any one location at any given time,\nwith the exception of required in-person testing. Attendance at MN Virtual High School is based on logging in\ndaily and making progress in their courses.\n\u25cf HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 9-12): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\n11\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST ONE assignment/quiz/test (something that is graded) for at least one\ncourse EACH SCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8): \u200bTo be in attendance students must make progress by\ncompleting or submitting AT LEAST TWO assignments/quizzes/tests (things that are graded) EACH\nSCHOOL DAY.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (grades 6-8) \u200bare required to virtually attend the weekly direct instruction\nwith their core area teachers. There will be specific days and times for each course.\nALL STUDENTS:\n\u25cf Meeting minimum attendance requirements, however, does not mean a student is making adequate\nprogress. Only submitting one assignment every day is not a sufficient amount of work to pass\ncourses by the end of the term.\n\u25cf STUDENTS SHOULD REGULARLY BE COMPLETING ABOUT 3-5\nASSIGNMENTS/QUIZZES/TESTS (ITEMS THAT ARE GRADED) IN THE SUM TOTAL OF\nTHEIR CLASSES EACH SCHOOL DAY. We highly recommend using the course schedules\nprovided and actively WORKING FOR 6 HOURS EVERY SCHOOL DAY to support adequate\nprogress.\n\u25cf All assignments are submitted through Moodle, the classroom platform.\n\u25cf Blank or incomplete assignments are not counted towards attendance.\n\u25cf Reading course material or touching base with a teacher or case manager is not sufficient for\nattendance.\n\u25cf The expectation is that if a student can only complete the minimum of one assignment on a given day,\nthey will be doing more work over the course of the rest of the week to maintain adequate progress.\n\u25cf Regarding students who experience anxiety: they must still meet minimum attendance requirements\nevery day. Teachers, support specialists, school counselors, and the school social worker are all\navailable during the regular school day to help a student. The first step is communication. Staff\nmembers can give guidance to calming strategies and help make a plan of action for that day.\n\nExcused absence\u200b \u2013 An acceptable absence as determined by the school. The burden of proof for a student\nbeing excused from school is placed on the parent/guardian of the student. Determination of the excused\nnature of the absence is left to principal discretion. \u200bPlease note:\u200b students may access and attend school virtually\nfrom their home 24 hours a day seven days a week. Excused absences should be few, far between, and due to\nextreme circumstances. The very nature of an online school allows students to maintain attendance while\ncircumstances would ordinarily prevent them from attending school. \u200bStudents who maintain their adequate\nwork completion percentages on a weekly basis will not be required to provide documentation except in the\ncase of a pre-approved absence (family vacation, etc.).\nThe following reasons are examples which are recognized by the school as legitimate:\na) Parent/doctor verified illness\u200b: an absence verified by a parent/guardian or doctor, in writing within\nthree days of the absence\u200b. The excuse must specify the health condition and why it prevents\nattendance at the online school. Should the illness prevent them from attending school virtually from\ntheir home, a doctor\u2019s note is required to verify the severity of the illness and the length of time\nanticipated that student would not be able to work online.\nb) Family emergencies\u200b: an absence resulting from a serious illness, injury or death of an immediate family\nmember.\nc) School directed activities\u200b: absences for field trips, athletic trips, music trips or other school activities\nplanned by the school.\nd) Prearranged family vacations\u200b: an exceptional circumstance which requires families to take a vacation\nduring the school year. A pre-approved absence must be submitted by email from the legal\nguardian/parent to the \u200bschool administration\u200b \u200b14 days in advance\u200b and be approved by the school prior\nthe absence in order for the absence to be excused. Work should be completed \u200bin advance\u200b of the\nabsence in preparation for the absence.\ne) Suspension\u200b: as defined by the charter school board of directors.\nf) Court appearances\u200b: an absence by a student who has been court ordered to appear and the absence has\n12\n\nbeen previously arranged by the parent/guardian with the school. Proof of court order and of actual\nappearance is required to verify this type of absence.\ng) Computer problems:\u200b an absence by a student whose computer access is not working. This problem\nmust be resolved within 24 hours. \u200bA maximum of 1 day can be excused for this reason; please\nrefer to the student contract signed at enrollment concerning alternate forms of computer\naccess for students.\nh) Exceptional circumstances\u200b: any other circumstances where permission may be granted at the discretion\nof the school principal, which is coordinated by the student with the principal, in advance or as the\noccasion arises. Example would be childbirth, hospitalization, detention center, etc.\nNote:\u200b In almost all cases, online work and adequate progress toward course completion is expected.\nUnexcused absence\u200b - An absence for reasons that are not recognized by the school authorities as legitimate.\nUnexcused absences are tracked for truancy and enrollment purposes. After any unexcused absence occurs,\nstudents are expected to return to successful completion of coursework in order to avoid truancy consequences\nand/or losing their enrollment in the charter school. \u200bThe following are examples of unacceptable reasons for\nabsence:\na)\nCar trouble\nb)\nOver slept; alarm did not work\nc)\nShopping\nd)\nRequired to perform duties at home (i.e. babysitting, cleaning, or caring for a relative) that\ninterfere with student\u2019s ability to complete schoolwork\ne)\nFamily vacation (not pre-approved); Visiting\nf)\nWork\ng)\nNo email or call from the parent/guardian verifying the absence\nh)\nComputer issues of more than one 24 hour period\ni)\nPersonal (no reason given)\nj)\nTruancy, as defined in this document\nk)\nOther absences as determined on a case by case basis\nl)\nMissing required state testing\nExtended absences\u200b \u2013 An absence of more than five consecutive school days. Students who accrue more than\nfive\u200b consecutive absences must provide documentation for the absences to be considered excused absences.\nStudents who are unable to provide this documentation are subject to attendance and truancy policies.\nStudents who accrue \u200bten\u200b consecutive absences will be warned that they are jeopardizing their enrollment in the\ncharter school\u200b. \u200bStudents who accrue \u200bfifteen\u200b consecutive unexcused absences will be dropped from the\nenrollment of the charter school, and, thereafter, would need to complete the enrollment application in order\nto be admitted back into school. No credit is earned in the time the student is not enrolled.\nA student absent for an extended period of time due to illness is eligible for a leave of absence. Parents should\ncontact the principal to make these arrangements. If a student has suffered an extended long term illness and\nrequired work has not been completed, the student may request an extension by completing the extension\nrequest form seven days prior to the end of the term. The principal has the authority to grant or to deny the\nextension based on individual student circumstance. The online school\u2019s curriculum is available 24 hours a\nday/seven days a week from any computer.\nTruancy\u200b \u2013 Truancy does not apply to students 18 years old or older. Students under the age of 18 are truant if\nthey do not generate attendance every day of school, which is defined by students logging into their courses\nand making progress daily.\n\n13\n\nIV. PROCEDURES\nA. In order to make the online system work alongside traditional school attendance policies, a conversion\nfrom continuous daily progress over to days absent must occur. Attendance calculations are made each\nday for all students. This is done by tracking students daily logged time into their coursees and\ndetermining the sum of successful work completion for all classes to determine the increase for each\nstudent.\n1. Students are expected to spend an average of approximately 60 minutes per day, per class in\norder to meet the school\u2019s expectation for attendance and avoid truancy.\n2. Students are also expected to make adequate progress in their classes daily to stay on pace to\ncomplete their courses by the end of the term.\nB. Enrollment at MN schools requires attendance. By law, students who accrue 15 consecutive unexcused\nabsences are dropped from the charter school enrollment. This policy applies \u200bto all students\nregardless of the age of the student. For students who are \u200b18 years of age and older\u200b, truancy does not\napply; however, attendance is still monitored in order to comply with the Minnesota Statute concerning\nenrollment in the charter school.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bfive days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter\nschool sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the\nabsences along with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will\nresult in loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n2. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\nsends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and parents/guardians regarding the absences\nalong with the warning that continued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in\ntheir loss of enrollment in the charter school.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200b15 days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the charter school\ndrops the students from enrollment and sends notification, via U.S. Mail, to the student and\nparents/guardians of that fact.\nC. For students who are under \u200b18 years of age\u200b, enrollment laws as well as truancy laws apply. The charter\nschool must comply with the truancy procedures of each individual county in which students reside.\nFor truancy, absences are totaled; the absences do not need to be consecutive school days for truancy\nto be in effect. In addition, the school tracks consecutive absences in order to comply with the\nMinnesota statutes concerning enrollment.\n1. When a student has accrued \u200bthree total days of unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends the\nstudent and parents/guardians with a warning letter concerning the absences, compulsory\neducation laws, and the fact that the student is considered a continuing truant.\n2. Depending on the policies and procedures of a student\u2019s county of residence, the student will\nbe referred to the county for early intervention when appropriate for the specific county.\n3. When a student has accrued \u200bseven cumulative days of unexcused absences\u200b, the student is\nconsidered a habitual truant. The school notifies the student and parents/guardians that the\nschool has filed a truancy offense report with the student\u2019s county of residence. The school\ncooperates with the county from this point forward, and a school official attends court should\nthe need arise.\n4. When a student has accrued \u200bten days of consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school sends\nnotification via U.S. Mail to student/parent of student absences along with the warning that\ncontinued absence totally 15 consecutive schools days will result in the student\u2019s loss of\nenrollment in the charter school. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county worker\nof the student\u2019s jeopardized enrollment.\n14\n\n5. When a student has accrued\u200b \u200bfifteen days \u200bof consecutive unexcused absences\u200b, the school is\nrequired by Minnesota statute to drop the student from enrollment and sends notification via\nU.S. Mail to student/parent of that fact. In addition, the school will notify the student\u2019s county\nof the student\u2019s change in enrollment status.\nV. DISSEMINATION OF POLICY\nCopies of this policy are available to all students and parents. Should the policy be changed in the middle of a\nschool year, students and parents will be notified in a timely manner.\nStudent Conduct and Discipline\nStudent behavior should be based on the respect of others.

Minnesota Testing facilities are located throughout Minnesota. Parents/students are responsible for\nthe transportation to and from testing facilities annually, and when necessary for students required to participate in\nassessment retakes for the GRAD components of the assessments. Failure to participate in these tests will result in a\ndelay of receiving a diploma, and unexcused absences.\nDetailed schedules for the MCA testing window will be updated as they are made available by the MDE. Please note\nthat specific locations and dates for all assessments are communicated via email to families. Parents and students are\nresponsible for identifying and attending the appropriate location for MCA and Career & College Readiness\nassessments from the schedule provided by MNVS.\nTESTING REQUIREMENTS\nMCA:\nGrade 7: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 8: Mathematics & Reading\nGrade 10: Reading\nGrade 11: Mathematics\nGrade 11: ACT with Writing\n\n15\n\nGraduating students may also take college and career preparatory exams (i.e. ACT, Accuplacer, ASVAB) as approved\nby MTS MNVS to meet graduation requirements pursuant to Minnesota State Statute \u200b120B.30\u200b.

School districts and charter schools may\nnot prohibit a student from applying to enroll part-time in online learning. In order to apply, students under 18 must\nhave the written consent of his/her parent or guardian and submit a completed Online Learning Supplemental Notice\nof Student Registration form accompanied by the MNVS part-time enrollment packet.\nPart-time Enrollment Attendance\nSuccessful students in the supplemental online learning program at Minnesota Virtual High School spend a minimum\nof one hour each school day online working on each of their courses, making at minimum 1% progress in each course\neach school day. Although flexibility exists in the online program, students are expected to make adequate progress\neach week in order to ensure successful completion and full-credit earning. Failure to participate in this course weekly\nmay jeopardize your enrollment in this course.\nProgress Reporting\nThe Supplemental Program coordinator will submit progress reports to the local school contact person upon\ncompletion of the student\u2019s academic term. The student and family may access regular progress reports in the online\nlearning platform through the student gradebook anytime.\nFinal Grades and Submissions\nSemester and final grades are submitted to the school counselor within 10 days of the end of the term. Successfully\ncompleted MNVS courses carry 1.5 semester credits; credit conversions and graduation requirements do differ\nbetween school districts. Contact your school counselor for your local district\u2019s graduation requirements and credit\nconversion.\nACADEMIC GUIDELINES\nProgress Monitoring\nStudents and parents may check student progress by logging into the MNVS Classroom and viewing the student\ngradebook. The Grades link is on the home page for each course in which the student is enrolled. Questions about\nstudent progress should be directed to the teacher of a specific course.\nListed information includes: Student Name, Course Name, Course Grade. Assignment Grade, and Percentage\nComplete.\nCourse Grade: The course grade accounts for the quantity and quality of work that the student has completed thus\nfar in the course. \u200bThe Course Grade is the grade that determines the student\u2019s final grade at the end of the\ngrading period.\nAssignment Grade: The assignment grade is the quality of the assignments that have been submitted and graded.\nPercent Complete: The percent complete is the percentage of the assignments completed in the course thus far.\n\n16\n\nTo access detailed information for each course click on the \u201cGrades\u201d link; this will expand the screen to the user view\nand show all graded and upcoming assessments. Click on an individual assignment to view details and teacher\nfeedback.\n\nGrade Calculation Guide\nGrade Percentage (range)\n93-100%\n90-92.9%\n87-89.9%\n83-86.9%\n80-82.9%\n77-79.9%\n73-76.9%\n70-72.9%\n67-69.9%\n63-66.9%\n60-62.9%\n0-59.9%\n\nGrade\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nDF\n\nReset Procedure\nThe following is the recommended procedure for allowing assessment resets.\nHomework Assignments and Course Assessments\nHomework assignments, essays, unit quizzes, midterm exams, and final exams may be reset upon student discussion\nwith the course teacher when course assignments and previous course assessments (quizzes) are at a passing level. This\nincludes essay assignments and unit tests in accordance with the plagiarism policy (if applicable).\nAcademic Integrity\nMNVS expects a full commitment to academic integrity from each of our students. By enrolling in MNVS your\ncommitment to academic integrity as a student at MNVS will be recorded. Should your teacher suspect that cheating or\nplagiarism has taken place, you may be required to verify your work which can include additional demonstration of\nmastery such as additional course work, verbal demonstration of comprehension, and proctored exams in school at the\nMNVS offices.\na) Your work on each assignment will be completely your own.\nb) Your collaboration with another classmate on any assignment will be pre\u200b-\u200bapproved by your instructor.\nc) You will not practice cheating or plagiarism in any form.\nd) You will not allow others to copy your work.\ne) You will not misuse content from the Internet.\nPlagiarism\nWhat is it and why does it matter?\nPlagiarism is using other people\u2019s words, phrases, or ideas without giving them credit. Even if you put someone else\u2019s\nideas into your own words, you must still give them credit. Plagiarism can also take the form of copying the\norganization and/or sentence structure of another source. Plagiarism is intellectual theft and is unethical. Many colleges\nand universities expel students who have been found guilty of plagiarizing.\n\n17\n\nWhen do I need to document sources used in an assignment?\nHere are general guidelines that will help you determine if you need to document any sources used in an assignment. If\nyou have any questions about whether you should document a source, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment.\nYou need to document your sources in the following situations:\n\u25cf When you use or refer to someone else\u2019s words or ideas from a magazine, book, newspaper, song, TV\nprogram, movie, Web site, computer program, or any other format.\n\u25cf When you copy the exact words from a source.\n\u25cf When you paraphrase or summarize someone else\u2019s words or ideas.\n\u25cf When you copy or reprint any diagrams, charts, illustrations, or pictures.\nYou do NOT need to document sources in these situations:\n\u25cf When you write from your own experiences, observations, or insights.\n\u25cf When you write about your own conclusions about a subject or event.\n\u25cf When you are using \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that can be found in several sources. An example of common\nknowledge is: \u201cGeorge Washington was the first president of the United States.\u201d This is a fact that is found in\nseveral sources.\nHow do I document sources in my assignment?\nIf you have any questions about documenting sources in an assignment, ask your teacher before you turn in the\nassignment. Also, here are links to information about MLA documentation style, which is the format that many MNVS\nteachers prefer:\nhttp://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/\nhttp://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/DocMLA.html\nhttp://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/newhelp/res_strategy/citing/mla.html\nConsequences for Plagiarizing at Minnesota Virtual High School\nIf a student plagiarizes an assignment in whole or in part, (s)he may retake the assignment for 50% credit. Notation of\nthe plagiarism will be documented in the student\u2019s MNVS permanent record. If the student should plagiarize another\nassignment in any subsequent class or subsequent term, (s)he may receive a zero for the assignment with no chance of\nretaking it. An additional offense may result in a failing grade for the course. The school district will be notified\nregarding each occurrence of plagiarism and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. \u200bWhen in doubt, ask your\nteacher!\nTECHNOLOGY AWARENESS\nAlong with global access comes availability of materials that may not be considered appropriate in the\nclassroom. However, on a global network it is impossible to control all the materials. Ultimately, \u200bstaff and\nstudents \u200bare responsible for compliance with the established standards when using media and informational\nresources.\nMTS MNVS Internet Use Policy\nStaff and Students \u200bare responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a\nclassroom. Communications on the network are often public in nature. General school rules for behavior and\ncommunications apply. Internet access is \u200brequired f\u200b or all MNVS students. MNVS assumes no responsibility for\nany phone charges, line costs or usage fees for connectivity to the Internet.\n\n18\n\nAccess is provided for \u200bstaff and students \u200bto communicate and conduct research with others in relation to\nschool activities in compliance with 1998, SB230, an Act relating to technology use, KAR 701.5:120 and the\nChildren\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) signed into law on December 21, 2000. Access to network services\nis given to staff and students who agree to act in a considerate and responsible manner. Access is a privilege,\nnot a right. Therefore, based upon the acceptable use guidelines outlined in this document, the directors will\ndeem what are appropriate: email uses, internet resources, and use of school/district resources. Their decisions\nare final. The director will instruct the systems engineer to deny, revoke, or suspend specific student user\naccounts, and reconfigure proxy-server and filtering settings. Further disciplinary actions will fall within the\ndiscretion of the directors.\nThe user is expected to abide by the following network and communication rules:\n\u25cf Do not use the network in such a way that would disrupt the use of the network by other users.\n\u25cf Do not exchange passwords or access other\u2019s network accounts. The user is responsible for the\nsecurity of his/her own password.\n\u25cf Do not attempt unauthorized access, including so-called \u201cHacking\u201d and other unlawful activities\nonto network or computer system configurations or bypass security programs to change settings or\naccess. Violations of this rule will be considered vandalism.\n\u25cf \u201cCyber Bullying\u201d will not be tolerated.\n\u25cf Do not use for commercial activities by for-profit organizations, product promotions, political\nlobbying, or illegal activities.\n\u25cf Do not use public property for personal gain (this is considered a felony and is subject to\nprosecution).\n\u25cf Do not violate copyright policies on software sharing or authorship of electronic information\n\u25cf Do not access, download, transmit, send or attach documents containing inappropriate matter on\nthe internet and World Wide Web harmful to minors (pornographic, obscene, or sexually explicit,\nthreatening, harassing materials).\n\u25cf Do not access, copy or transmit another\u2019s messages without permission.\n\u25cf The school is not responsible for loss or damage to a file due to unauthorized access or usage.\nViolation of any of the rules and responsibilities will result in a loss of access and may result in other\ndisciplinary or legal actions.\nSecurity Information\nAll the data you provide to us is protected to ensure both the privacy and security of your data. MNVS uses\nstate\u200b-\u200bof\u200b-\u200bthe art technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible to ensure that no one will be able to\ntamper with, intercept, or access your data. Remember to keep your account information private and secure.\nNetiquette\nNetiquette is etiquette, or appropriate behavior and manners on the internet. When using the Internet, there are widely\naccepted rules and behaviors to follow. At times being online can feel \u201cpretend\u201d because you cannot see the person\nyou are communicating with. It is important to make a positive impression, and to maintain that behavior as an online\nstudent.\nHow you interact and behave online is seen by both instructors and students. Students must remember they are dealing\nwith \u201creal\u201d people online and they should use the same manners they would use in a traditional school setting. It also\nimportant to note that once students log in to their school accounts, all communication via chat and email are\nrecorded.\n19\n\nBelow are some general netiquette guidelines to follow:\n\u25cf Remember the person on the other end of the computer.\nStudents are responsible for good behavior while logged into the MNVS online learning platform, just as they\nare in a traditional school building. Always use a computer in a way that shows consideration and respect. It is\nillegal to use obscene, profane, threatening, or disrespectful language.\nDo not threaten or disrespect an instructor or administrator. These actions not only violate the MNVS\u2019s policy,\nbut may violate penal laws in the United States. (f.s. 847.001 Obscene Literature; Profanity).\n\u25cf Think before you send or submit.\nIt is illegal to create harmful computer viruses. This violates the privacy of others. Never transmit or publish\nany information or content that you think will be harmful. This violates school policy and also violates penal\nlaws in the United States. (f.s. 815 Computer\u200b-\u200bRelated Crimes). Never publish any information, software, or\ncontent that violates the rights of others.\n\u25cf Be respectful.\nNever view files that were not intended for your use.\nPost discussion board threads that are a reflection of your understanding of the topic at hand in a respectful\nand intellectual manner.\nWrite in complete sentences with proper grammar. Remember that writing in all CAPS reflects a yelling tone\nand is both disrespectful and inappropriate in online communication. Instead, use \u200bitalics \u200bwhen you are making a\nparticularly important point.\n\u25cf The internet is not private.\nWhile MNVS works to ensure data privacy, email must not always be considered private. Never say anything\nvia email that you wouldn't mind seeing on the school bulletin board or in the local newspaper.\nThe information that you put on the internet, whether in school or outside of school (e.g. social networking),\nexists forever.\n\u25cf Many websites and pages are copyrighted.\nDo not violate the terms and conditions of any web site you access.\nAlways cite the works of others that you use in discussions, conversations, and the course work you submit.\n\u25cf Do not \u200bgive out personal information to non\u200b-\u200bMNVS staff. For example, you should not share the following\noutside of school: Your full name, home phone number, home address, email\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe Minnesota Virtual High School online Classroom provides a rich, interactive experience for students.
